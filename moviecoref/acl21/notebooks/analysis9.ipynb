      "EXT - LA LOUISIANE (TAVERN) - NIGHT We see a small basement tavern, with a old rustic sign out front that reads, \"La Louisiane\". A SUBTITLE APPEARS: \"The Village of NADINE, FRANCE\" TWO SHOT LT.HICOX and LT.ALDO RAINE Aldo is dressed like a French civilian. Hicox is dressed in a German grey S.S. Cap't uniform. They look out of a window, in a apartment, in the village of Nadine, overlooking the tavern. LT.ALDO You didn't say the goddamn rendez-vous was in a fuckin basement. LT.HICOX I didn't know. LT.ALDO You said it was in a tavern? LT.HICOX it is a tavern. LT.ALDO Yeah, in a basement. You know, fightin in a basement offers a lot of difficulties, number one being, your fighting in a basement. Wilhelm Wicki, joins the SHOT, dressed in a German S.S. Lieutenant uniform. WICKI What if we go in there, and she's not even there? LT.HICOX We wait. Don't worry, she's a British spy, she'll make the rendez-vous. WE SEE the other Basterds, dressed in French civilian clothes, are in the room as well, they are, Donowitz, Hirschberg, and Utivich. And in the back of the room, dressed in the grey uniform of a S.S. Lieutenant, Hugo Stiglitz sits off by himself, sharpening his S.S. DAGGER on his leather belt looped around his boot. Anybody not in the scene from the Basterds opening chapter, is dead. Lt.Hicox watches Stiglitz off by himself on the other side of the room, SHARPENS his dagger menacingly. .Stiglitz is fucking werid... Lt.Hicox approaches Stiglitz... LT.NICOX Stiglitz, right? STIGLITZ That's right, sir. He continues bringing the blades edge, up, then, down on the leather strap. LT.HICOX I hear your pretty good with that? Meaning the blade. Stiglitz doesn't answer. LT.HICOX You know, we're not looking for trouble, right now. We're simply making contact with our agent. Should be uneventful. However, on the off chance I'm wrong, and things prove eventful. I need to know, we can all remain calm. The renegade Gerry Sergeant, stops his blades progress, and looks up at the limy Lieutenant. STIGLITZ I don't look calm to you? LT.HICOX Well, now you put it like that, I guess you do. He turns his attention back to his blade. Hicox moves over to Aldo, and asks him privately; LT. HI COX This Gerry of yours, Stiglitz? Not exactly the loquacious type, is he? Aldo just looks at him. LT.ALDO Is that the kinds man you need, the loquacious type? LT.HICOX Fair point, Lieutenant. LT.ALDO So y'all git in trouble in there, what are we suppose to do? Make bets on how it all comes out? LT.HICOX If we get into trouble, we can handle it. But if trouble does happen, we need you to make damn sure no Germans, or French, for matter, escape from that basement. If Frau Von Hammersmark's cover is compromised, the mission is kaput. SGT.DONOWITZ Speaking of Frau Von Hammersmark, who's idea was it for the death trap redez-vous? LT.HICOX She chose the spot. SGT.DONOWITZ Well isn't that just dandy? LT.HICOX Look, she's not a military strategist. She's just a actress. LT.ALDO Ya don't got to be Stonewall Jackson to know you don't want to fight in a basement. LT.HICOX She wasn't picking a place to fight. She was picking a place, isolated, and without germans. PFC.HIRSCHBERG Lieutenant, I hate to be contrary, but I got me a Nazi pissin on Louisianna two-o'clock. They move to the window, and sure enough, ONE LONE NAZI PRIVATE, relieves himself against the side wall. Lt.Bicox, this was definitely, not the plan. LT.HICOX Shit. Sgt.Donowitz chides him; SGT.DONOWITZ So what do you think your fraulein Von Hammer - LT.HICOX - Obviously, I don't know,Sgt. The British officer watches the German soldier, who's not suppose to be there. When Hugo Stiglitz joins him at the window. Stiglitz looks down at the urinating Nazi, S.S. dagger in hand. STIGLITZ If we're going, let's go. He sheaths the dagger. EXT - LA LOUISIANE (BASEMENT TAVERN) - NIGHT The GERMAN PISSING PRIVATE, sloppily finishes his task. Craming his noodle back in his pants, he descends the stairs that lead him back into the basement tavern. We Follow him... INT - LA LOUISIANE (BASEMENT TAVERN)- NIGHT .Inside the basement tavern, La Louisiane. it has a very low hanging basement ceiling. A old looking wood bar off to the right. And the only other space in the little tavern, is taken up by two large(at least in here) tables, which take up both half's of the room. And despite rumors to the contrary, one of the two tables, is completely filled with drunken celebrating Nazi enlisted men, of which our urinating friend is one of five. FIVE NAZI'S ONE GERMAN MASTER SGT, ONE FEMALE GERMAN SGT , and THREE MALE GERMAN PRIVATES. The Five Nazi's are sitting around the table, drinking, and playing a very fun game with none other then the fraulein of the hour, UFA diva, BRIDGET VON HAMMERSMARK. Dressed to the nines in a chic Forties style women's suit, complete with fedora. The game their playing consists of each player having a card with the name of a famous person, real or imaginary, stuck to their forehead. The player doesn't know what name is on their forehead. So they ask the others questions to figure out who they are. The Five Germans, five cards read; MASTER SGT #1 , a powerfully built stocky type POLA NEGRI FEMALE SGT #2(BEETHOVEN), GERMAN PRIVATE #3(MATA HARI), GERMAN PRIVATE #4 (EDGAR WALLACE), GERMAN PRIVATE #5 (WINNETOU). And Bridget Von Hammersmark, who wears her card in the brim of her fedora, has GENGHIS KHAN. It's German#5 (WINNETOU) turn to ask questions. The DIALOGUE will be in GERMAN, and SUBTITLED into ENGLISH. Also, while some dialogue will be written for the German Soldiers, it will be mostly made up from the exuberance of their game playing, and celebrating. WINNETOU .okay, I'm not German. Am I American? The whole table bursts out laughing. FEMALE SGT/BEETHOVEN Yes you arel EDGAR WALLACE Well, not really. SGT.POLA NEGRI What do you mean, not really? Of course he is. EDGAR WALLACE Well if he's so American, how come he's never been translated into English? He's not American. He's suppose to be American, but he's not a American creation. In fact, he's something very different. WINNETOU Okay, I'm a fictional, literary character, from the past, I'm American, and that's controversial. BRIDGET/GENGUS No it's not controversial. The nationally of the author, has nothing to do with the nationally of the character. The Character is the character. Hamlet's not British, he's Danish. So yes, this character was born in America. WINNETOU Well I'm glad that's settled. If I had a wife, would she be called a squaw? He's got it. The table Laughs. The TABLE YES! WINNETOU Is my bloodbrother, Old Shatterhand? The TABLE Yes! WINNETOU Did Karl May write me? The TABLE Yes! In the BACKGROUND, WE SEE, our three counterfeit German Officers, Hicox, Wicki, and Stiglitz, enter the basement tavern. They obviously. see the five German soldiers, but their too far away for us to read their face. No doubt their less then happy. Fraulein Von Hammersmark see's them as well. Without getting up, she waves to them. the audience QZ BRIDGET Hello, my lovelies, I will join you in moments. I'm finishing up a game with my five new friends here. LT.HICOX No hurry, Frau Von Hammersmark. Take your time, enjoy yourself. BRIDGET So who are you? To Winnetou WINNETOU I am WINNETOU, CHIEF of the APACHES! The table CHEERS, and APPLAUD the Apache Chief, as he takes the card off his forehead. The other Four German Soldiers drink down there beer . Bridget Von Hammersmark knock backs her champagne. part of the game MATA HARI Frau Von Hammersmark, when your friends came in, did you realize you did a double take, like in the movies? BRIDGET Really? No, I wasn't aware of that at all. MATA HARI They must be second nature to you now? Did they teach you how to do a double take in the movies? BRIDGET Well, yes they did, but it's not really that difficult. SGT.POLA NEGRI Do one for us. The Tableheartily agrees. Bridget looks directly at the Master Sgt, and does a perfect, and perfectly funny, Double Take. The Table loves it. q3. MATA HARI My turn, I want to try. Mata Hari, looks directly at Beethoven, and does a Double Take. EDGER WALLACE I want to try. He does. Soon the whole Table is doing dueling Double Takes. HICOX - WICKI - STIGLITZ watch the table do dueling Double Takes. Obviously, they don't understand. THEN... .Bridget Von Hammersmark rises, and excuses herself from the Table. She removes the card stuck in her fedora, looking at the name Gengus Khaun for the first time. BRIDGET Gengus Khaun! I would never of gotten that. She walks over, and joins the masquerading Germans table, the Gentlemen rise. She greets each warmly with a french cheek kiss, as if she knows them well. They all take a seat. The two Basterds, and one Brit, drink Whiskey. The taverns PROPRIETOR, a older, big bellyed Frenchman named EARL, comes over to the table, and pours more champagne into Bridget's Champagne glass. He leaves, returning back behind the bar, with the YOUNG FRENCH BARMAID, the only other person in the establishment. Obviously, they speak GERMAN, SUBTITLED into ENGLISH; LT.HICOX I thought this place was suppose to have more French then Germans? BRIDGET Normally that's true. The Sgt over there's wife, just had a baby. His commanding officer gave him, and his mates the night off to celebrate. WICXI We should leave. BRIDGET F No, we should stay. For one drink at least. I've been waiting for you in a bar, it would look strange if we left before we had a drink. LT.HICOX She's right, just be calm, and enjoy your booze. BACK TO THE GERMAN TABLE The French Barmaid, has taken Bridget's place in the rousing, rowdy game. She tells them, her person must be French, or she won't know them. Winnetou thinks for a moment, then writes a name on a card. The Barmaid puts it on her forehead, It says; NAPOLEON. The Germans all laugh. BACK TO THE BASTERDS TABLE BRIDGET There's been some new developments. The cinema venue has changed. LT.HICOX Why? BRIDGET No one knows. But that in itself shouldn't be a problem. The cinema it's been changed to is considerably smaller then The Ritz. So whatever materials you brought for The Ritz, should be doubly effective here. Now this next piece of information is colossal, try not to over react. The Fubrer, will be attending tomorrow. Hugo Stiglitz does a SPIT TAKE. Bridget's eyes bore holes in him. BACK TO THE REAL GERMANS They see Hugo do the spit take, and burst out laughing. Keeping it up, they begin to do dueling spit takes, like they did dueling double takes earlier. Needless to say, they all get wet. BACK TO BASTERDS BRIDGET You'll be going as Ernst Schuller. You'll say your a associate producer on Riefenstahl's \"Tiefland\". It's the one German production not under Goebbels control, and Leni wouldn't be caught dead at a Goebbels film affair. To Hicox BACK TO REAL GERMAN TABLE Master Sgt.Pola Negri, drinks his beer, as he looks over, dreamily, at Bridget Von Hammersmark at the other table. BACK TO BASTERDS We See in Bridget continues to brief Hicox on his identity. the B.G., the German Master Sgt stand up from his table, and head toward Fraulein Von Bammersmark. BRIDGET .the films gone through many delays, and Leni's heath is deteriorating, so if you have to speak... Hicox, seeing the German Master Sgt approach, signals for her to cool it. SGT.POLA NEGRI Frau Von Hammersmark, I was just thinking, could you sign a autograph to my son on his birthday? BRIDGET I'd love to Wilhelm. This handsome happy Sgt, just became a father today. The Pretend Officers offer congratulations to the Sgt. The German Master Sgt, CLICKS his heels, and bows before his superior officers. To the Table SGT.POLA NEGRI Thank you, heil Hitler. He raises his hand .... as do the seated phony officers; \"Heil Hitler\". As she takes a rather fancy fountain pen from her clutch.. BRIDGET So Wilhelm, do you know the name of this progeny yet? SGT.POLA NEGRI I most certainly do, fraulein. His name is Maximilian. Even the slightly psychotic Stiglitz, likes this German Sgt. STIGLITZ Wonderful name, Sgt. SGT.POLA NEGRI Thank you, Lieutenant. When he's old enough to ride a bicycle, I will buy him a blue one. And I will paint on the side \"The Blue Max\". He thrusts out his beer stein, for the officers to cheers. They do. Bridget finishes signing her autograph, with a big flourish. BRIDGET There you go. But wait, I'm not finished yet. She reaches into her clutch, and pulls out some lipstick. Applies some ruby red color to her lips, and then kisses the napkin, leaving a big red lip print. Then hands the treasured item to the young father. BRIDGET Nothing but the best for little Maximilian. SGT.POLA NEGRI Thank you fraulein, thank you. Max may not know who you are now. But he will. I will show him all of your movies. He will grow up with your films, and this napkin on his wall. Then, to the whole tavern... SGT.POLA NEGRI I purpose a toast to the greatest actress in Germany! There is no Dietrich, there is no Riefenstahl, only Von Hammersmark! The whole room toasts. This would be a good time for the German Sgt to go back to his table, and his men. And he almost does.... but... since he is drunk, and star struck, he out wears his welcome. SGT.POLA NEGRI So, Frau Von Hammersmark, what brings you to France? 97 . Feeling any good Nazi officer's patience would of been exhausted long ago, Lt.Hicox butts in. LT.HICOX None of your business,Sgt. You might not have worn out your welcome with the fraulein, with your drunken boorish behavior, but you have wore out your welcome with me. The Table of game playing Soldiers, hear this, and get quiet. LT.HICOX Might I remind you Sgt.,your a enlisted man. This is a officers table. I suggest you stop pestering the fraulein, and rejoin your table. The German Master Sgt., looks quizzically at the officer. SGT.POLA NEGRI Excuse me Cap't, but your accent is is very unusual. The whole room pauses-for different reasons... SGT.POLA NEGRI Where are you from? A silent moment passes between the two tables, then the two German born impostors spring into action. WICKI Sgt.! You must be ether drunk or mad, to speak to a superior officer with such impertinentness! Stiglitz, STANDS and YELLS to the other table; STIGLITZ I'm making YOU,... (Pointing at WINNETOU) .and YOU,.. .responsible, for him. I suggest you take hold of your friend, or he'll spend Max's first birthday in jail for public drunkenness! Pointing at Edgar Wallace Pointing at Sgt.Pola The Germans SPRING UP, and take hold of Sgt.Pola... 1W WHEN... A GERMAN VOICE rings out; GERMAN VOICE Then might I inquire? The Five known Germans move aside, reveling the unknown German in the room, unseen till now, our old friend from before MAJOR DEITER HELLSTROM of the GESTAPO. The Major stands from the little table he was sitting at. OS MAJOR HELLSTROM Like the young newly christened father, I too have a acute ear for accents. And like him, I too find yours odd. From where do you hail, Cap't? Wicki jumps in; WICKI Major, this is highly inappr - MAJOR HELLSTROM T wasn't speaking to you Lt.Saltzberg, (Turning to STIGLITZ) or you ether, Lt.Berlin. (Looking at HICOX) I was speaking to Cap't I--don't-know-what. The Gestapo Major is now standing beside Sgt.Pola, before the impostors table. Lt.Hicox, calmly explains his origin. LT.HICOX I was born in the village that rests in the shadow of Piz Palu. MAJOR HELLSTROM The mountain? LT.HICOX Yes. In that village we all speak like this. Have you seen the Riefenstahl film? MAJOR HELLSTROM Yes. f q s LT. HICOX Then you saw me. You remember the skiing torch scene? MAJOR HELLSTROM Yes I do. LT.HICOX In that scene was myself, my father, my sister, and my two brothers. My brother is so handsome, the director Pabst, gave him a Close Up. As Bridget Von Hammersmark places a cigarette in a ivory cigarette holder, which Hicox, as if on cue, lights for her, she says; BRIDGET Major, if my word means anything, I can vouch for everything the Young Cap't has just said. He does hail from the bottom of Piz Palu, he was in the film, and his brother is far more handsome then he. The impostors laugh. Then....so does the Gestapo Major. He turns to the Sgt. MAJOR HELLSTROM You should rejoin your friends. Which the young Sgt is more then happy to do. That table begins playing there game again. Major Hellstrom, the highest ranking officer in the room, bows graciously to the female German celebrity. MAJOR HELLSTROM May I join you? BRIDGET By all means, Major. The Gestapo Major sits at the table, opposite Lt.Hicox, and Wicki. The French Barmaid brings over the Majors beer stein. MAJOR HELLSTROM So that's the source of your bazaar accent? Extraordinary. So what are you doing here Cap't? LT.HICOX Aside from having a drink with the lovely fraulein? ,00 . MAJOR HELLSTROM Well that pleasure requires no explanation. Chuckle...Chuckle MAJOR HELLSTROM I mean in country. Your obviously not stationed in France, or I'd know who you are. LT I'! I COX You know every German in France? MAJOR BELLSTROM Worth knowing. LT.HICOX Well, there in lies the problem. We never claimed to be worth knowing. Chuckle... Chuckle. MAJOR HELLSTROM All levity aside, what are you doing in France? Chuckling as he asks LT.HICOX Attending Goebbels film premiere as the frauleins escort. MAJOR HELLSTROM Your the frauleins escort? LT.HICOX Somebody has to carry the lighter. Chuckle chuckle. BRIDGET The Captain is my date, but all three are my guests. We're old friends Major, who go back along time. Longer then a actress would care to admit. Chuckle chuckle. MAJOR HELLSTROM Well, in that case, let me raise a glass to the three luckiest men in the room. BRIDGET I'll drink to that. They cheers. BACK TO THE REAL GERMAN TABLE They continue to have alot of fun playing their game. BACK TO OFFICERS TABLE MAJOR HELLSTROM I must say, that game their playing looks like a good bit of fun. I didn't join them, because your quite right Cap't, officers and enlisted men shouldn't fraternize. But seeing as we're all officers here, (Bowing to BRIDGET) .and sophisticated lady friends of officers. What say we play the game? Lt.Hicox begins to refuse, when Bridget , interrupts him; feeling she knows better BRIDGET okay, one game. MAJOR HELLSTROM WUNDERBAR The Major borrows five cards from the other table, and lays them out in front of Bridget and the officers. MAJOR HELLSTROM So the object of the game, is to write the name of a famous person on your card. Real or fictitious, doesn't matter. For instance, you could write Confucius or Fu Manchu. (He SNAPS his FINGERS) Eric' More pens. And they must be famous. No Aunt Inga's. When you finish writing, put the card face down on the table, and move it to the person to your left. The person to your right, will move their card in front of you. You pick up the card without looking at it, lick the back, and stick it on your forehead like so. He demonstrates. Back to players )oz. MAJOR HELLSTROM (CON'T) And in ten yes or no questions, you must guess who you are... As Major Hellstrom finishes explaining the finer points of the game, The CAMERA PANS OFF HIM, and BEGINS SLOWLY ZOOMING INTO STIGLITZ. The Majors dialogue begins to FADE AWAY. Untill we're in a SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK. Which is RED FILTERED FOOTAGE of Hugo being savagely WHIPPED by somebody wearing a GESTAPO UNIFORM, SUPERIMPOSED over his CLOSE UP. The Flashback disappears. It's driving Stiglitz crazy, being this close to a Gestapo uniform, and not plunging a knife into it. The Majors Voice comes back on the soundtrack. MAJOR HELLSTROM .So let's give it a try, shall we? Everybody write your names. The Five players write their names... Then move their cards to the right... Everybody sticks their cards on their forehead... MAJORBRIDGETWILHELMARCHIEHUGO HELLSTROMVON HAMMERSMARKWICKIHICOXSTIGLITZ is is is is is KING MARCOBULLDOGBRIGITTEG.W. KONG POLO DRUMMOND HELM PABST MAJ.KING KONG I'll start, give you the idea. Am I German? They laugh. BRIDGET No. MAJ.KING KONG Am I a American? They laugh - but then Wicki says; WICKI Wait a minute, he goes to !03 . BRIDGET Don't be ridiculous, obviously he wasn't born in America. MAJ.KING KONG So... . I visited America, aye? The Table says; \"Yes\". MAJ.KING KONG Was this vist...fortuitous? WICKI Not for you. MAJ.KING KONG .Bummm. My native land, is it what one would call, exotic? The Table confers, and decides, yes it is exotic. MAJ.KING KONG Hummmm. That could be ether a reference to the jungle, or the Orient. I'm going to let my first instinct take over, and ask, am I from the jungle? The Tablesays; \"Yes you are\". MAJ.KING KONG Now gentlemen, around this time you could ask, weather your real or fictitious. I however, think that's too easy, so I won't ask that, yet. Okay, my native land is the jungle? I visited America, but my visit was not fortuitous to me, but the implication is that it was to somebody else. When I went from the jungle to America,... .Did I go by boat? \"Yes\". MAJ.KING KONG Did I go against my will? \"Yes\". MAJ.KING KONG On this boat ride, ... . Was I in chains? \"YESIS MAJ.KING KONG When I arrived in America,...Was I displayed in chains? \"Yes\". MAJ.KING KONG Am I the story of the Negro in America? The Table says, \"No\". MAJ.KING KONG Well then I must be King Kong. Be throws the card on the table. They applaud him. MAJOR HELLSTROM Nov since I answered correctly, you all need to finnish your drinks. The three counterfeit Nazi's knock back their whiskey. MAJOR HELLSTROM Now, who's next? LT.HICOX Major, I don't mean to be rude. But the four of us are very good friends. And the four of us haven't seen each other in quite a while. So... Major, I'm afraid, you are intruding. MAJOR HELLSTROM I beg to differ Cap't. It's only if the fraulein considers my presence a intrusion, that I become a intruder. How about it fraulein? Am I intruding? BRIDGET Of course not, Major. MAJOR HELLSTROM I didn't think so. It's simply the young Cap't is immune to my charms. The Table's not sure what to do, is this a confrontation? Then, the Major laughs. MAJOR HELLSTROM I'm just joking, of course I'm intruding. MAJOR HELLSTROM Allow me to refill your glasses gentlemen, and I will bid you and the fraulein adieu.

They all mutter, \"a thousand year reich\", and toast glasses. The Gestapo Major puts down his beer stein, and then WE HEAR a CLICK, under the table. MAJOR HELLSTROM Did you hear that? That's the sound of my Luger pointed right at your testicles. !Q( LT.HICOX Why do you have a Luger pointed at my testicles? MAJOR HELLSTROM Because you've just given yourself away, Cap't. Your no more German then that scotch. LT.HICOX Well, -Major - BRIDGET - Major - MAJOR HELLSTROM - Shut up slut. You were saying? To Hicox LT.HICOX I was saying that makes two of us.

As well as Bridget's legs, right besides the Nazi Major's. Her pretty gams are sure to be chewed up in the possible crossfire. SGT.STIGLITZ And at this range, I'm a real Fredrick Zoller. Hugo alsobrings out his dagger, and sitcks it in the table top. MAJOR HELLSTROM Hummmmm ... Looks like we have a bit of a sticky situation here. LT. H ICOX What's going to happen, Major, is your going to stand up, and walk out that door with us. MAJOR HELLSTROM No no no no no no, I don't think so.

Lt.Hicox picks up his thirty-three year old single malt scotch, and says; Pointing at his heart LT.HICOX (ENGLISH) 'Well, if this is it old boy, I hope you dont mind if I go out speaking the kings? MAJOR HELLSTROM (ENGLISH) By all means, Cap't. The English film critic, commando, picks up the thirty-three the Nazi Major bought him, and says; LT.HICOX There's a special rung in hell reserved for people who waste good scotch. And seeing as I might be rapping on the door momentarily... He downs the stuff. LT.HICOX (To the Nazi MAJOR) I must say, damn good stuff, sir. He puts the glass down. LT.HICOX Now about this, \"Pickle\", we find ourself's in. It would appear, there's only thing left for you to do. MAJOR HELLSTROM (ENGLISH) And what would that be? LT.HICOX Stiglitz. STIGLITZ Say, auf wiedersehen to your balls! STIGLITZ FIRES into HELLSTROM'S BALLS... As does HICOX, HITTING not only Hellstrom, but BRIDGET as well. HELLSTROM FIRES into HICOX'S BALLS and KNEE CAPS.

The SHOOTING STOPS...the SMOKE caused by the gunfire ... starts to DISSIPATE... The only one in the room left alive, is the young German Sgt, with the machine gunn. WE HEAR the feet of the soldiers outside, reach the basement entrance. The door opens... , .The German Sgt, sends FIFTY BULLETS in the doors direction... No one goes through it. What we have here, is a rabbit hole like situation. No one inside is getting out, no one outside is getting in. The young German Sgt, YELLS in ENGLISH, to the outside; GERMAN SGT You outside! Who are you? British, American, what? Aldo's Voice YELLS down the hole; ALDO'S VOICE Were American's 1 What are you? OS GERMAN SGT I'm a German you idiot! ALDO'S VOICE You speak English pretty good for a German! OS GERMAN SGT I agree! So let's talk! ALDO'S VOICE Okay, talk! OS GERMAN SGT I'm a father! My baby was born today in Frankfurt! Five hours ago! His name is Max! We were in here drinking and celebrating! They're the ones that came in shooting and killing! It's not my fault! Ito. ALDO'S VOICE Okay, okay, it wasn't your fault! What's your name soldier? OS GERMAN SGT Wilhelm! ALDO'S VOICE That's the same name as one of the guys you just killed! OS WILHELM They attacked us! ALDO'S VOICE Okay Wilhelm... .is anybody alive on our side? OS WILHELM No! We hear a VOICE OFF SCREEN, yell out; BRIDGET'S VOICE I'm alive! Wilhelm spins in the direction of the voice. OS STILL R On the floor, with a bullet in her BLOODY LEG, lies the alive Bridget Von Hammersmark. The German Sgt points the muzzle of the machine gunn at the German celebrity; with hate in his eyes. ALDO'S VOICE Who's that? OS WILHELM (To BRIDGET, LOW) Make a sound whore, and I spit! Meaning the muzzle. ALDO'S VOICE Wilhelm, who is that? OS WILHELM is the girl on your side? Pause. ALDO'S VOICE Which girl? OS WILHELM 1 Who do you think, Von Hammersmark! ALDO'S VOICE Yeah, she's oar's! OS WILHELM (To Bridget LOW in GERMAN) I thought so. So you run with the American's now, huh?

ALDO'S VOICE Well now, Willi, that's true enough. But something you need to know, so you don't get the wrong idea. Ain't none of us give a fuck bout that girl. But, admittedly, if you kill her, it would fuck up our plans. But you'll be dead by then anyway, so what'd you care? And lets not forget that little gatzenjammer Max, growin up without a pop. So in the spirit of gettin you home to him, we got a deal, Willi? OS WILLI Okay Aldo, I'm going to trust you! Come down, no guns! Aldo and Hirschberg come down the stairs, showing open hands. Willi keeps his machine gunn trained on them. Aldo with his hands up, says; A ALDO Hey Willi, what's with the machine gunny I thought we had a deal? WILLI We do have a deal, now git the girl and go. ALDO Not so fast, Willi, we only have a deal, we trust each other. A Mexican stand off ain't trust. WILLI You need guns on me for it to be a Mexican stand off. ALDO you got guns on us, you decide to shoot, we're dead. Up top, they got grenades, they drop 'em down here, your dead. That's a Mexican stand off, and that wasn't the deal. WILLI Just take that fucking traitor, and go! See? Now your down here Now you get tricky - t ALDO - No tricks!- Ain't nobody gittin tricky, Willi; I swear to god, I'm too damn dumb toget tricky. But (MEANING HIRSCHBERG) him and I lived upto the deal. We came down without guns. Now it's your turn. No trust,no deal. Willi pointing gunn at them.,,, -thinking... ALDO i know your scarred. I'm scarred, he's scarred, we're all scarred. So what's it gonnabe Willi? Ether we got a deal, or you might as well just shoot us now. Willi decides... He puts the machine gunn down on the bar. WILLI Fine. Take that fucking traitor and get her out of my sight. ALDO Danka, Willi, danka. okay, Hirschbeg, you grab her shoulder - WHEN... From behind Aldo and Hirschberg, Bridget lifts up Major Hellstroms Luger, and EMPTIES the remaining bullets into Sgt.Willi, who FALLS to the floor, DEAD. Aldo and Hirscberg spin around shocked. ALDO You fuckin bitch! I had a deal with that man! From the floor, the bloody, sweaty, and in excoriating pain , German movie star, says to the two American soldier's she's just meeting for the first time; she'll probably lose that leg BRIDGET He was a enemy soldier, who knew who I was. He couldn't live. Hirscberg loses control, and RICKS the woman on the floor, hard in the side. HIRSCHBERG I ought'a beat your fuckin head in ALDO Stop it. Just pick her up, and get that bitch outta here. HIRSCHBERG Aldo, she just- ALDO - She's right. HIRSCHBERG What? ALDO I said, she's right. He was a Nazi soldier. If he lived, he would doomed the mission. ELI )Is,. ALDO (CON'T) Don't mean I like it, don't mean I like her, but she's right. Now as Willi said, \"take this fuckin traitor, and get 'er outta my sight\". EXT - LA LOUISIANE - NIGHT Hirschberg, carrying Fraulein Von Hammersmark, and Aldo emerge from the bowels of the basement. Bridget points at a fancy black sedan, telling them it's her's. Aldo, Hirschberg, Bridget, Donowitz, and Utivich pile in, and take off.\n"
