M: IN BLACK --
N: We hear the feral, primeval sounds of a jungle at night. A timpani bangs an ominous beat.
T: FADE IN ON:
N: A JUNGLE - NIGHT A BUNNY nervously walks through the dark, foreboding forest, frightened by every shadow and moving leaf.
C: YOUNG JUDY
D: Fear. Treachery. Bloodlust! Thousands of years ago, these were the forces that ruled our world. A world where prey were scared of predators. And predators had an uncontrollable biological urge to maim and maul and...
E: V.O.
N: The timpani crescendos. A JAGUAR leaps out of the shadows, attacks the bunny, who screams--
T: CUT TO:
N: INSIDE A BARN - A JUNGLE (SET) - NIGHT The action continues-- as imagined by an amateur stage production.
C: YOUNG JUDY
D: Blood, blood, blood!
N: Reams of red papier mch entrails ooze from the bunny. And when those run out-- projectile ketchup. Reveal: These are ANIMAL KID ACTORS. The bunny, JUDY HOPPS, 10, is our hero. And this is her play being staged. A banner reads: CARROT DAYS TALENT SHOW!
C: YOUNG JUDY
D: And death.
E: CONT'D
N: The CROWD looks on, confused. The music goes discordant as BOBBY CATMULL, a bobcat, bangs a drum.
C: YOUNG JUDY
D: Back then, the world was divided in two. Vicious predator or Meek prey. 2.
E: CONT'D
N: TWO BOXES drop down, labeled VICIOUS PREDATOR and MEEK PREY. The PREDATOR box lands on the jaguar. The MEEK PREY box lands on Judy. Her entrails get stuck outside the box. She drags them underneath with her.
C: YOUNG JUDY
D: But over time, we evolved, and moved beyond our primitive savage ways.
E: O.S. CONT'D
N: A YOUNG SHEEP wearing a white muumuu and a cardboard rainbow on his head does an improvisational dance across the stage. Judy and the jaguar burst out of their boxes, now wearing white muumuus, too.
C: YOUNG JUDY
D: Now, predator and prey live in harmony.
E: CONT'D
N: Judy and the jaguar shake hands as the sheep throws glitter.
C: YOUNG JUDY
D: And every young mammal has multitudinous opportunities.
E: CONT'D
C: ASTRONAUT SHEEP
D: Yeah, I don't have to cower in a herd anymore.
N: The Jaguar rips off his muumuu. She's wearing a homemade astronaut costume.
C: ASTRONAUT SHEEP
D: Instead I can be an astronaut.
E: CONT'D
N: Catmull plays a slide whistle.
C: ACTUARY JAGUAR
D: I don't have to be a lonely hunter any more.
N: The Jaguar rips off his muumuu. He's dressed in a suit.
C: ACTUARY
D: Today I can hunt for tax exemptions. I'm gonna be an actuary!
C: YOUNG JUDY
D: And I can make the world a better place! I am going to be...
N: Catmull plays a 70s-style cop show theme on the boom box. Judy rips off her muumuu, revealing a POLICE OFFICER UNIFORM.
C: YOUNG JUDY
D: A police officer!
E: CONT'D
N: Judy's parents, BONNIE & STU, look stunned. A mean fox kid, GIDEON GREY, snickers. He's sitting next to a WEASEL KID.
C: GIDEON GREY
D: Bunny cop. That is the most stupidest thing I ever heard.
C: YOUNG JUDY
D: It may seem impossible to small minds-- I'm looking at you Gideon Grey.
E: points at Gideon
N: Catmull drops down a backdrop showing a bright city skyline. He hits play on an uplifting song.
C: YOUNG JUDY
D: But just 211 miles away stands the great city of Zootopia! Where our ancestors first joined together in peace, and declared that anyone can be anything! Thank you and good night!
E: CONT'D
N: Judy gives a mighty thespian bow, to the sound of Catmull on organ. The audience applauds. Judy's parents look concerned.
S: EXT. CARROT DAYS FESTIVAL - LATER THAT DAY
N: A festival replete with food booths, games and rides-- all aggressively carrot-themed. Judy, in her Cop Costume, bounces along with her folks. We catch their conversation mid-stream.
C: STU HOPPS
D: Judy, you ever wonder how your mom and me got to be so darn happy?
C: YOUNG JUDY
D: Nope.
C: STU HOPPS
D: Well, we gave up on our dreams and we settled, right Bon?
C: BONNIE HOPPS
D: Oh yes, that's right, Stu. We settled hard. 4.
C: STU HOPPS
D: See, that's the beauty of complacency, Jude. If you don't try anything new, you'll never fail.
C: YOUNG JUDY
D: I like trying, actually.
C: BONNIE HOPPS
D: What your father means, hon, is it's gonna be difficult-- impossible even-- for you to become a police officer.
C: STU HOPPS
D: Right. There's never been a bunny cop.
C: BONNIE HOPPS
D: No.
C: STU HOPPS
D: Bunnies don't do that.
C: BONNIE HOPPS
D: Never.
C: STU HOPPS
D: Never.
C: YOUNG JUDY
D: Oh. Then I guess I'll have to be the first one. Because I am gonna make the world... A better place!
E: parkours against a vendor's stand
C: STU HOPPS
D: OR... um, heck, you wanna talk about making the world a better place--
N: The trio arrives at the Hopps Family Farm carrot booth, which is manned by too many children to count.
C: STU HOPPS
D: --no better way to do it than becoming a carrot farmer.
E: CONT'D
C: BONNIE HOPPS
D: Yes! Your dad, me, your 275 brothers and sisters-- we're changing the world. 5.
C: STU HOPPS
D: Yep.
C: BONNIE HOPPS
D: One carrot at a time...
C: STU HOPPS
D: Amen to that. Carrot farming is a noble profession.
N: Judy spots GIDEON GREY stalking some SMALL ANIMALS. She remains fixed on Gideon as Stu and Bonnie yap on obliviously.
C: BONNIE HOPPS
D: Mmm hmm. Just putting the seeds in the ground.
E: O.S.
C: STU HOPPS
D: Ahh, at one with the soil.
E: O.S.
N: We're back on Bonnie and Stu's conversation now.
C: BONNIE HOPPS
D: You get it. I mean, it's great to have dreams.
C: STU HOPPS
D: Yeah, just as long as you don't believe in em too much. Where in the heck'd she go?
E: finally noticing Judy's absence
N: ACROSS THE FAIR... From behind a tree, Judy watches as Gideon Grey intimidates the astronaut sheep, SHARLA.
C: GIDEON GREY
D: Gimme your tickets right now, or I'm gonna kick your meek little sheep butt.
C: SHARLA
D: Ow! Cut it out, Gideon!
C: GIDEON GREY
D: Baa-baa. What're ya gonna do, cry?
N: Gideon swipes Sharla's fair tickets.
C: YOUNG JUDY
D: Hey!
E: O.S.
N: Judy charges toward the danger.
C: YOUNG JUDY
D: You heard her. Cut it out.
E: CONT'D
N: Gideon turns. There's Judy, projecting the image of a tiny Clint Eastwood.
C: GIDEON GREY
D: Nice costume, loser. What crazy world are you living in where you think a bunny could be a cop?
C: YOUNG JUDY
D: Kindly return my friends' tickets.
N: Gideon pats the tickets in his pocket.
C: GIDEON GREY
D: Come and get `em.... But watch out, `cause I'm a fox-- and like you said in your dumb little stage play, us predators used to eat prey. And that killer instinct's still in our Dunnahh.
N: TRAVIS THE WOLF HENCHMAN KID (sotto, to Gideon) Uh, I'm pretty much sure it's pronounced D-N-A.
C: GIDEON GREY
D: Don't tell me what I know, Travis.
C: YOUNG JUDY
D: You don't scare me, Gideon.
N: Gideon shoves Judy. Hard. She falls. The other prey animals flee to safety behind a nearby tree, leaving her to face the thugs alone.
C: GIDEON GREY
D: You scared now?
N: Judy starts to tear up. Her nose starts to twitch. TRAVIS THE WOLF HENCHMAN KID Lookit her nose twitch. She is scared!
C: GIDEON GREY
D: Cry little baby bunny. Cry, cry --
N: Suddenly-- BAM! Judy kicks Gideon in the face with her hind legs. He stumbles back, then checks his lip for blood.
C: GIDEON GREY
D: Oh, you don't know when to quit, do ya?
E: CONT'D
N: He unsheathes his claws like a switchblade, then slaps her, drawing blood from her cheek. She cowers, as do her scared friends behind the tree.
C: GIDEON GREY
D: I want you to remember this moment-- the next time you think you will ever be anything more than just a stupid, carrot farming dumb bunny.
E: CONT'D
N: Gideon and his pal head off, laughing and high-fiving. The prey animals run back over to Judy, who wipes the blood from her cheek. She fights tears, defeated. GARETH THE DOUBTING SHEEP BOY That looks bad.
C: SHARLA
D: Are you okay, Judy?
C: YOUNG JUDY
D: Yeah... Yeah, I'm okay.
N: Judy smiles and then whips out the tickets as she gets up.
C: YOUNG JUDY
D: Here you go.
E: CONT'D
C: SHARLA
D: Wow! You got our tickets!
N: GARETH THE DOUBTING SHEEP BOY You're awesome, Judy!
C: SHARLA
D: Yeah! That Gideon Grey doesn't know what he's talkin' `bout.
C: YOUNG JUDY
D: Well, he was right about one thing...
N: Judy picks up the cop hat, puts it on her head.
C: YOUNG JUDY
D: I don't know when to quit.
E: CONT'D
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. POLICE ACADEMY TRAINING FACILITY - DAY
N: Hopps and the comparatively huge CADETS sit in a circle as MAJOR FRIEDKIN, an intimidating drill instructor, lectures.
C: MAJOR FRIEDKIN
D: Listen up Cadets! Zootopia has 12 unique ecosystems within its city limits-- Tundra Town, Sahara Square, Rainforest District, to name a few. You're gonna have to master all of them before you hit the streets-- or guess what? You'll be dead!
E: to Hopps
N: IN SAHARA SQUARE SIMULATOR: Hopps struggles through the sand.
C: MAJOR FRIEDKIN
D: Scorching sandstorm. You're dead, bunny bumpkin!
E: CONT'D
N: ON THE VINE-COVERED MONKEY BARS: Hopps swings across the bars, simulating the RAINFOREST DISTRICT. She falls off, landing face first in the mud.
C: MAJOR FRIEDKIN
D: 1000 foot fall. You're dead, carrot face!
E: O.S. CONT'D
N: TUNDRA TOWN ICE WALL: Judy and the cadets sprint toward the wall. The CLAWED ANIMALS dig into the ice wall. Hopps slides off.
C: MAJOR FRIEDKIN
D: Frigid ice wall. You're dead, farm girl!
E: CONT'D
N: IN THE BOXING RING: Hopps gets in the ring with a BIG BISON.
C: MAJOR FRIEDKIN
D: E-normous criminal.
E: CONT'D
N: Hopps gets punched in the nose.
C: MAJOR FRIEDKIN
D: You're dead! 9.
E: CONT'D
T: THREE QUICK CUTS OF FAILURE:
C: MAJOR FRIEDKIN
D: Dead! / Dead! / Dead!
E: O.S. CONT'D
N: IN THE TOILET: Hopps ruses into a stall. The toilet is considerably larger than she is. She shuts the door. We see her climb up the toilet. In the next stall, we see the feet of a Hippo. Then, KERSPLASH! Hopps falls into the toilet.
C: MAJOR FRIEDKIN
D: Filthy toilet. You're dead, fluff butt!
E: CONT'D
N: HOPPS ON HER OWN-- She runs at sunset-- after everyone else has called it a day. We HEAR the drill instructor's voice echoing in her mind.
C: MAJOR FRIEDKIN
D: Just quit and go home, fuzzy bunny!
E: V.O. CONT'D
N: Then those of her parents...
C: STU HOPPS
D: There's never been a bunny cop.
E: V.O.
C: BONNIE HOPPS
D: Never.
E: V.O.
C: STU HOPPS
D: Never.
E: V.O.
N: Then Gideon's...
C: GIDEON GREY
D: Just a stupid, carrot farming dumb bunny.
E: V.O.
N: OVERNIGHT, IN THE BARRACKS: Hopps stays up late studying, doing sit ups. ON THE ICE WALL: Hopps bounds up the wall, jumps off of the backs of the big animals and makes it over, impressing the Major Friedkin.
C: IN THE RING:
D: 10.
N: Hopps dodges a few swings. The Bison misses. Hopps bounds over him and uses his momentum-- kicking his other hand into his face, knocking him down.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. POLICE ACADEMY - DAY
N: It's graduation day. MAYOR LIONHEART is at the podium.
C: LIONHEART
D: As Mayor of Zootopia, I am proud to announce that my Mammal Inclusion Initiative has produced its first police academy graduate.
N: Judy stands proudly in her cop uniform.
C: LIONHEART
D: Valedictorian of her class, ZPD's very first rabbit officer... Judy Hopps.
E: CONT'D
N: Judy walks to the stage as those in attendance cheer-- her FAMILY chief among them. ASSISTANT MAYOR BELLWETHER applauds. She smiles at Judy, lost in the moment.
C: LIONHEART
D: Assistant Mayor Bellwether? Her badge.
E: CONT'D clearing his throat
C: BELLWETHER
D: Oh! Yes right.
C: LIONHEART
D: Thank you.
N: Bellwether steps forward to pin Hopps' ZPD badge on her.
C: LIONHEART
D: Judy, it is my great privilege to officially assign you to the heart of Zootopia: Precinct One, City Center.
E: CONT'D
N: Judy can barely contain her glee. Her parents are in shock.
C: BELLWETHER
D: Congratulations, Officer Hopps. 11.
C: JUDY
D: I won't let you down. This has been my dream since I was a kid.
C: BELLWETHER
D: Ya know, it's a... It's a real proud day for us little guys.
C: LIONHEART
D: Bellwether, make room will ya? Come on.
N: Lionheart shoves Bellwether out of the way.
C: LIONHEART
D: Okay, Officer Hopps. Let's see those teeth!
E: CONT'D
N: A group of PHOTOGRAPHERS aim their cameras. Lionheart steps in front of Bellwether, edging her out of the photo. The flashbulbs pop.
S: EXT. BUNNYBURROW TRAIN STATION - DAY
N: Stu, Bonnie, and several SIBLINGS accompany Judy to the train station.
C: BONNIE HOPPS
D: We're real proud of you, Judy.
C: STU HOPPS
D: Yeah. Scared, too.
C: BONNIE HOPPS
D: Yes.
C: STU HOPPS
D: Really, it's kind of a proud-scared combo. I mean, Zootopia. It's so far a away... It's such a big city.
C: JUDY
D: Guys-- I've been working for this my whole life.
C: BONNIE HOPPS
D: We know. And we're just a little excited for you, but terrified.
C: JUDY
D: The only thing we have to fear is fear itself. 12.
C: STU HOPPS
D: And also bears. We have bears to fear, too. To say nothing of lions, and wolves...
C: BONNIE HOPPS
D: Wolves?
C: STU HOPPS
D: ...weasels...
C: BONNIE HOPPS
D: You play cribbage with a weasel.
C: STU HOPPS
D: And he cheats like there's no tomorrow. You know what, pretty much all predators-- and Zootopia's full of `em.
C: BONNIE HOPPS
D: Oh, Stu.
E: scolding
C: STU HOPPS
D: And foxes are the worst.
C: BONNIE HOPPS
D: Actually, your father does have a point there. It's in their biology. Remember what happened with Gideon Grey.
E: retreating
C: JUDY
D: When I was 9. Gideon Grey was a jerk, who happened to be a fox. I know plenty of bunnies who are jerks.
C: STU HOPPS
D: Sure. Yeah, we all do. Absolutely. But just in case, we made you a little care package to take with you.
C: BONNIE HOPPS
D: And I put some snacks in there.
N: Stu begins pulling a bunch of PINK FOX DETERRENTS from a bag.
C: STU HOPPS
D: This is fox deterrent. 13.
C: BONNIE HOPPS
D: Yeah that's safe to have there.
C: STU HOPPS
D: This is fox repellent...
C: BONNIE HOPPS
D: Okay, the deterrent and the repellent. That's all she needs.
C: STU HOPPS
D: Check this out!
N: Stu removes a Fox Taser, fires it up. It sizzles.
C: BONNIE HOPPS
D: Oh for goodness sake. She has no need for a fox taser, Stu.
C: STU HOPPS
D: Oh c'mon. When is there not a need for a fox taser?
C: JUDY
D: Okay, look-- I will take this to make you stop talking.
N: Judy grabs the pink fox repellent from the bag as the train pulls up.
C: STU HOPPS
D: Terrific! Everyone wins!
C: TRAIN CONDUCTOR
D: Arriving-- Zootopia Express!
C: JUDY
D: OK. Gotta go. Bye!
N: Judy heads for the train, head held high. No turning back. Stu and Bonnie watch, both holding back tears. Suddenly, the emotion catches up with Judy. She turns, runs back to her parents, hugs them tight.
C: JUDY
D: I love you guys.
E: CONT'D
C: BONNIE HOPPS
D: Love you, too!
N: One more squeeze, then Judy runs off and jumps on the train.
C: STU HOPPS
D: Oh cripes, here come the waterworks.
C: BONNIE HOPPS
D: Oh Stu, pull it together.
C: JUDY
D: Bye everybody!
C: COTTON
D: Bye, Judy! I love you!
C: CROWD OF BUNNIES
D: Bye!
N: As the train pulls away, her family runs next to it, waving.
C: JUDY
D: Bye!
N: Judy looks back as their faces recede into the distance. The train blasts past Bunnyburrow, passing its exponentially increasing population sign. Judy pulls out her iPhone and clicks play... her new life is about to begin and we
T: CUT TO:
N: A MONTAGE -- As Hopps takes the train, it rounds a curve. She looks up. Her eyes light up. There in the distance is...
S: EXT. ZOOTOPIA CITY - ESTABLISHING
N: ...THE UNBELIEVABLE ANIMAL METROPOLIS of ZOOTOPIA, which is comprised of amazing habitat "boroughs." The train whips past TUNDRATOWN, SAVANNA CENTRAL, RAINFOREST DISTRICT, MEADOWLANDS, SAHARA SQUARE, etc.
S: INT. ZOOTOPIA CENTRAL STATION - A LITTLE LATER
N: Hopps spills out of the train... and we are now in a MULTI- SCALE ENVIRONMENT: everything from mice to elephants.
S: EXT. DOWNTOWN ZOOTOPIA - A LITTLE LATER
N: Hopps emerges into the main Zootopia central plaza. It's an amazing, magnificent place. A JUMBOTRON featuring a gazelle pop star, GAZELLE, blares its message in a loop.
C: GAZELLE
D: I am Gazelle. Welcome to Zootopia!
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. HOPPS'S APARTMENT BUILDING, HALLWAY - DAY
N: DHARMA ARMADILLO, Hopps's older ARMADILLO LANDLADY, opens the door to Hopps' new apartment-- which we can't see yet.
C: DHARMA ARMADILLO
D: And welcome to the Grand Pangolin Arms. "Luxury Apartments with Charm."
N: Hopps discovers the room is a tiny, crappy studio apartment.
C: DHARMA ARMADILLO
D: Complimentary de-lousing once a month. Don't lose your key.
E: CONT'D handing over the keys
C: HOPPS
D: Thank you!
N: As Dharma leaves, Hopps' volatile, artsy NEIGHBORS, KUDU and ORYX POOTOSSER, pass by in the hall.
C: HOPPS
D: Oh hi, I'm Judy! Your new neighbor!
E: CONT'D
C: KUDU POOTOSSER
D: Yeah? Well we're loud.
C: ORYX POOTOSSER
D: Don't expect us to apologize for it.
N: Before Hopps can respond, they're gone, leaving Hopps alone. She looks around... blank-faced so it's tough to read her emotions.
C: HOPPS
D: Greasy walls... rickety bed... 16.
C: KUDU POOTOSSER
D: Shut up!
E: O.S.
C: ORYX POOTOSSER
D: You shut up!
E: O.S.
C: KUDU POOTOSSER
D: No! You shut up!
E: O.S.
C: HOPPS
D: Crazy neighbors... I love it!
E: big smile as she flops on the bed
N: As the shouting continues, she stretches out on her bed, exhausted but overjoyed. WAKE UP MONTAGE - MORNING
T: Quick, rhythmic cuts of:
N: - Alarm clock: Beep. Beep. Beep. - Dressing: Vest. Badge. Belt. On the bedside table sits the PINK FOX REPELLENT. Judy glances at it and smirks-- taking it would be silly-- she walks out of frame. HOLD on the table. One second. Then Judy's hand comes back into frame and grabs the Repellent.
S: INT. ZOOTOPIA POLICE DEPARTMENT - MORNING
N: Utter mayhem. COPS parade PERPS through the lobby-- one is wearing cuffs and a plastic (not scary) safety muzzle, he complains to the BEAR COP marching him by.
C: LEOPARD
D: C'mon! He bared his teeth first.
N: We land at the front desk and find CLAWHAUSER, a PUDGY CHEETAH COP, happily eating a bowl of Lucky Chomps cereal.
C: HOPPS
D: Scuse me! Down here? Hi.
E: O.C.
N: Clawhauser leans over the desk to find Hopps.
C: CLAWHAUSER
D: O-M goodness! They really did hire a bunny. What?! 17.
E: MORE
C: CLAWHAUSER
D: I gotta tell ya, you are even cuter than I thought you'd be.
E: CONT'D
C: HOPPS
D: Ooo, uh, you probably didn't know, but a bunny can call another bunny "cute," but when other animals do it, it's a little...
E: a little wince
C: CLAWHAUSER
D: I am so sorry. Me, Benjamin Clawhauser, the guy everyone thinks is just a flabby, donut-loving cop, stereotyping you...?
E: gasps, realizing
C: HOPPS
D: It's okay-- oh, you've actually you've actually got a-- there's a-- in your neck-- the fold-- the-- there's--
N: Clawhauser removes a small donut from under some neck fat.
C: CLAWHAUSER
D: Oh, there you went, you little dickens!
N: He crams the donut into his mouth.
C: HOPPS
D: I should get to roll call, so... which way do I?
E: awkwardly laughing
C: CLAWHAUSER
D: Oh! Bullpen's over there to the left.
C: HOPPS
D: Great, thank you!
N: Clawhauser watches admiringly as she heads to the bullpen.
C: CLAWHAUSER
D: Aw... That poor little bunny's gonna get eaten alive. 18.
E: to himself, wistful
S: INT. ZPD - BULLPEN - CONTINUOUS
N: Hopps enters the bullpen, by far the smallest animal in the room: rhinos, buffalo, hippos, elephants, etc. Hopps holds her paw out to a tough RHINO, MCHORN.
C: HOPPS
D: Hey. Officer Hopps. You ready to make the world a better place?
N: McHorn gives Hopps a reluctant fist bump, nearly knocking her off the chair.
C: OFFICER HIGGINS
D: TEN HUT!
E: O.S.
N: In walks CHIEF BOGO, a gruff CAPE BUFFALO. He takes the dais. Everyone snaps to attention and starts stomping the floor.
C: BOGO
D: All right, all right. Everybody sit.
N: As Hopps sits, she disappears below the DESK that is meant for a rhino.
C: BOGO
D: I've got three items on the docket. First... we need to acknowledge the elephant in the room. Francine, happy birthday.
E: CONT'D nods to ELEPHANT
N: An elephant, FRANCINE, blushes as other cops clap.
C: BOGO
D: Number two: There are some new recruits with us I should introduce. But I'm not going to, because I don't care. Finally...
E: CONT'D
N: He turns to a push pin-pocked MAP that's covered in photos of MISSING MAMMALS. Hopps's eyes go wide.
C: BOGO
D: ...We have 14 missing mammal cases. All predators, from a giant polar bear, to a teensy little otter. And City Hall is right up my tail to find them. This is priority number one. Assignments!
E: CONT'D
N: HIGGINS hands Bogo a stack of CASE FILES. Bogo puts on his reading glasses, examining the files as he assigns cases.
C: BOGO
D: Officers Grizzoli, Fangmeyer, Delgato-- your teams take Missing Mammals from the Rainforest District. Officers McHorn, Rhinowitz, Wolfard, your teams take Sahara Square. Officers Higgins, Snarlov, Trunkaby: Tundratown. And finally, our first bunny, Officer Hopps.
E: CONT'D
N: Hopps sits up, expectant but steely. Bogo looks at the final case file in his hand. He takes a dramatic breath, then:
C: BOGO
D: Parking Duty. Dismissed!
E: CONT'D
C: HOPPS
D: Parking duty? Uh, Chief? Chief Bogo?
E: runs after Bogo
N: Bogo looks around... then down to find Hopps.
C: HOPPS
D: Sir, you said there were 14 missing mammal cases?
E: CONT'D
C: BOGO
D: So.
C: HOPPS
D: So I can handle one. You probably forgot, but I was top of my class at the academy.
C: BOGO
D: Didn't forget. Just don't care.
C: HOPPS
D: Sir, I'm not just some "token" bunny.
C: BOGO
D: Well, then writing a hundred tickets a day should be easy.
N: He goes, slamming the door behind him. Judy stomps her foot.
C: HOPPS
D: 100 tickets...? I'm not gonna write 100 tickets... I'm gonna write 200 tickets! 20.
E: MORE
C: HOPPS
D: Before noon!
E: CONT'D then, to the closed door
S: INT. / EXT. METER MAID CART - DAY
N: Hopps dons a vest, buckles her seat belt, floors the pedal and... takes off at 2 miles an hour. Which leads to a PARKING METER MONTAGE -- Hopps zooms past a row of cars, marking their tires. Cruising the streets, her super-sensitive ears hear a meter ding. She slams her brakes-- then proudly issues Ticket #1. Ding! Another meter goes off. Then another. And another. She's on a roll. She looks down at her counter. It's at 200.
C: HOPPS
D: Boom! 200 tickets before noon.
N: A final ding... Reveal: her own traffic cart is at an expired meter. Hopps rolls her eyes and writes herself a ticket.
C: HOPPS
D: 201.
E: CONT'D
N: As Hopps puts the ticket on her windshield, she hears a voice across the street:
C: TRUCK DRIVER
D: Hey, watch where you're going, Fox!
E: O.S.
N: Hopps looks across the street to see... a RED FOX. Hopps looks at him, a little suspicious. The Fox looks around, then slinks into a caf. Hopps runs across the street and peeks in the window. It's an ice cream parlor, but... the FOX IS GONE.
C: HOPPS
D: Where'd he go...
E: sotto
S: INT. JUMBEAUX'S CAFE - MOMENTS LATER
N: Elephants scoop ice cream with their trunks, suck up nuts with their trunks. It's cute but also disgusting. As Hopps enters, she spots the fox, NICK WILDE, at the front of the line and overhears the proprietor, JERRY, addressing him.
C: JERRY JUMBEAUX, JR.
D: Listen, I don't know what you're doing skulking around during daylight hours, but I don't want any trouble in here... So hit the road.
N: Hopps unsnaps the holster of her PINK FOX REPELLENT.
C: NICK
D: I'm not looking for any trouble either, sir. I simply want to buy a Jumbo Pop for my little boy.
N: Ready for action, slowly creeping forward, Hopps's expression changes when she sees that Nick is with his TODDLER SON.
C: NICK
D: You want the red or the blue, pal?
E: CONT'D to the boy
N: Staring at the cute little boy, Hopps is embarrassed by her impulse. She snaps the Repellent holster and begins to leave.
C: HOPPS
D: I'm such a...
E: disgusted with herself
C: JERRY JUMBEAUX, JR.
D: Oh come on, kid. Back up. Listen, buddy, what? There aren't any fox ice cream joints in your part of town?
N: Hopps suddenly stops. Her ears go up and she turns around.
C: NICK
D: Uh, no no, there are. There are. It's just, my boy-- --this goofy little stinker-- he loves all things elephant. Wants to be one when he grows up.
E: tousles boy's hair
N: The boy gives a TOOT-TOOT with his toy elephant trunk.
C: NICK
D: Isn't it adorable? Who the heck am I to crush his little dreams, huh? Right?
E: CONT'D
C: JERRY JUMBEAUX, JR.
D: Look, you probably can't read, fox but the sign says... 22.
E: MORE
C: JERRY JUMBEAUX, JR. (slowly reads SIGN,
D: belittling) WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO REFUSE SERVICE TO ANYONE. So beat it.
E: CONT'D
C: ELEPHANT
D: You're holding up the line.
N: The little fox is about to cry, when Hopps walks up.
C: HOPPS
D: Hello? Excuse me?
E: O.S.
C: JERRY JUMBEAUX, JR.
D: Hey, you're gonna have to wait your turn like everyone else, metermaid.
C: HOPPS
D: Actually... I'm an officer. Just had a quick question. Are your customers aware they're getting snot and mucous with their cookies and cream?
E: revealing badge
N: An ELEPHANT COUPLE overhear and spit out their ice cream.
C: JERRY JUMBEAUX, JR.
D: What are you talkin' about?
C: HOPPS
D: Well, I don't wanna cause you any trouble, but I believe scooping ice cream with an un-gloved trunk is a Class 3 Health Code Violation...
N: A guilty EMPLOYEE releases a scoop from their trunk.
C: HOPPS
D: ...Which is kind of a big deal. Of course-- I could let you off with a warning if you were to glove those trunks and, I don't know, finish selling this nice dad and his son a... what was it?
E: CONT'D
C: NICK
D: A Jumbo Pop. Please.
C: HOPPS A Jumbo Pop.
D: 23.
C: JERRY JUMBEAUX, JR.
D: Fifteen dollars.
E: stews for a beat, then
C: NICK
D: Thank you so much. Thank you. Oh no, are you kidding me? I don't have my wallet. I'd lose my head if it weren't attached to my neck, that's the truth. Oh boy, I'm sorry pal. Gotta be about the worst birthday ever. Please don't be mad at me. Thanks, anyway.
E: to Hopps then, digs for wallet kisses him, to Hopps
N: He turns to go. Hopps slaps some money on the counter.
C: HOPPS
D: Keep the change.
S: EXT. JUMBEAUX'S CAFE - MOMENTS LATER
N: Hopps has the Toddler's hand. Nick holds a HUGE JUMBO-POP.
C: NICK
D: Officer, I can't thank you enough. So kind, really, can I pay you back?
C: HOPPS
D: Oh no, my treat-- it just-- y'know, it burns me up to see folks with such backward attitudes toward foxes. I just wanna say, you're a great dad and just a... a real articulate fella.
C: NICK
D: Ah, well, that is high praise. It's rare that I find someone so non- patronizing... Officer...
C: HOPPS
D: Hopps. Mr...
E: totally misses his dig
C: NICK
D: Wilde. Nick Wilde. 24.
C: HOPPS
D: And you little guy, you want to be an elephant when you grow up... you be an elephant-- because this is Zootopia, anyone can be anything.
E: to Toddler
N: Hopps puts a STICKER BADGE on the boy's chest.
C: NICK
D: Ah, boy, I tell him that all the time. All right here ya go-- Two paws. Yeah. Oh, look at that smile, that's a happy birthday smile! All right, give her a little bye-bye toot toot.
E: hands him popsicle
N: The kid toots.
C: HOPPS
D: Toot, toot!
C: NICK
D: Bye now!
C: HOPPS
D: Goodbye!
N: Hopps walks off with a spring in her step.
S: EXT. SAHARA SQUARE - DAY
N: Hopps continues to write tickets. As she leaves a ticket on another car, she can see a few blocks away. It's NICK and his KID. Hopps gives them a wave, but they don't notice her.
C: HOPPS
D: Oh! Hey, little toot toot--
N: Hopps realizes they are melting their jumbo-pop in the hot sun, channeling the juice into jugs. Huh? Nick and his kid pack the jugs into a van and NICK'S SON gets in the driver's seat. They drive off, passing Hopps, who stares, confused.
S: EXT. TUNDRATOWN - A LITTLE LATER
N: Hopps follows them to... Tundratown, where Nick's "son" uses his little paw prints to create molds they pour the popsicle juice into, creating dozens of smaller popsicles. Hopps looks on, scandalized.
S: EXT. SAVANNAH CENTRAL - A LITTLE LATER
N: Hopps watches them resell the "Pawpsicles" at marked-up prices to LEMMINGS... when one buys one, they all do.
C: NICK
D: Pawpsicles! Get your pawpsicles!
N: Nick rakes in the cash. As the lemmings leave, they throw their used popsicle sticks into a RECYCLING BIN. A second later, Nick's "son," FINNICK, emerges from the bin with a bundle of used popsicle sticks. Hopps is mortified.
S: EXT. LITTLE RODENTIA - A LITTLE LATER
N: Hopps watches Nick plop down a big bundle of USED POPSICLE STICKS in front of a MOUSE CONSTRUCTION WORKER.
C: NICK
D: Lumber delivery!
C: MOUSE CONSTRUCTION WORKER
D: What's with the color?
C: NICK
D: The color? Uh... It's redwood.
N: Hopps has now graduated to genuine anger.
S: EXT. OUTSIDE LITTLE RODENTIA - MOMENTS LATER
N: Nick hands Finnick a wad of cash.
C: NICK
D: 39...40. There you go. Way to work that diaper, big guy. Hey, no kiss bye-bye for daddy?
C: FINNICK
D: You kiss me tomorrow, I'll bite your face off. Ciao.
E: super-deep voice
N: As Finnick drives off in his van, BLARING LOUD FRENCH RAP MUSIC. We discover HOPPS behind it, and she is not happy.
C: HOPPS
D: Well. I stood up for you, and you lied to me. You liar! 26.
C: NICK
D: It's called a hustle, sweetheart. And I'm not the liar, he is.
N: Nick points behind Hopps. She turns... no one. She turns back. Nick is gone-- his tail disappears around a corner.
C: HOPPS
D: Hey!
N: Nick walks on, calmly. Hopps hurries up to him.
C: HOPPS
D: Alright, slick Nick, you're under arrest.
E: CONT'D
C: NICK
D: Really, for what?
C: HOPPS
D: Gee I don't know, how `bout selling food without a permit, transporting undeclared commerce across borough lines, false advertising...
N: Nick smiles and produces those documents.
C: NICK
D: Permit. Receipt of declared commerce. And I didn't falsely advertise anything. Take care.
C: HOPPS
D: You told that mouse the popsicle sticks were redwood!
C: NICK
D: That's right. "Red wood." With a space in the middle. Wood that is red. You can't touch me, Carrots, I been doing this since I was born.
E: then
C: HOPPS
D: You're gonna wanna refrain from calling me Carrots...
C: NICK
D: My bad. I just naturally assumed you came from some little carrot- choked podunk, no? 27.
C: HOPPS
D: Ah, no. Podunk is in Deerbrooke County, and I grew up in Bunnyburrow.
E: isn't it obvious?
C: NICK
D: Okay. Tell me if this story sounds familiar: Nave little hick with good grades and big ideas decides, "Hey lookit me, I'm gonna move to Zootopia-- where Predators and Prey live in harmony and sing Kumbaya!" Only to find-- whoopsie, we don't all get along. And that dream of becoming a big city cop? Double whoopsie! She's a meter maid. And whoopsie number threesie-- NO ONE cares about her or her dreams. And soon enough those dreams die and our bunny sinks into emotional and literal squalor living in a box under a bridge. Til finally she has no choice but to go back home with that cute, fuzzy wuzzy little tail between her legs to become-- you're from Bunnyburrow, is that what you said?-- so how `bout a carrot farmer... That sound about right?
E: harsher now, rapidly
N: She's speechless-- How did he get my number so quickly? A RHINO almost crushes her.
C: NICK
D: Be careful now, it won't just be your dreams getting crushed.
E: CONT'D
C: HOPPS
D: Hey! Hey! No one tells me what I can or can't be! Especially not some jerk who never had the guts to try to be anything more than a popsicle hustler!
E: ever-so-slightly rattled
C: NICK
D: Alright look, everyone comes to Zootopia thinking they can be anything they want. Well you can't. You can only be what you are. Sly fox. 28.
E: points to himself MORE
C: NICK
D: Dumb bunny.
E: CONT'D points to her
C: HOPPS
D: I am NOT a dumb bunny.
C: NICK
D: Right. And that's not wet cement.
N: She looks down. She's landed in wet cement.
C: NICK
D: You'll never be a real cop. You're a cute meter maid though. Maybe a supervisor one day. Hang in there...
E: CONT'D as he goes
S: INT. HOPPS'S APARTMENT, HALLWAY - EVENING
N: CLOSE ON HER WELCOME MAT: Hopps wipes off her cement covered feet. Then she enters THE APARTMENT -- Hopps turns on the radio. Everybody Hurts plays. She changes the station. A sadder song comes on. She changes the station repeatedly, each song progressively sadder. Finally, she lands on a treacly instrumental that will score the scene. She puts in a microwave dinner: CARROTS FOR ONE. Hopps takes her food (A SINGLE CARROT) and sits at a small table. Her phone rings. INSERT: MOM & DAD FACETIME. Hopps shakes her head, sighs, then puts on a fake smile and answers.
C: HOPPS
D: Oh hey, it's my parents!
C: BONNIE HOPPS
D: Aw there she is! Hi sweetheart!
N: THE FACETIME cuts between Bonnie on her phone. Stu will pop in and out of frame.
C: STU HOPPS
D: Hey there, Jude the Dude! How was your first day on the force?
C: HOPPS
D: It was real great. 29.
C: BONNIE HOPPS
D: Yeah? Everything you ever hoped?
C: HOPPS
D: Mmm. Absolutely. And more. Everyone's so nice. And I feel like I'm really making a difference--
C: STU HOPPS
D: Hey, wait a second. Holy cripes, Bonnie! Look at that!
E: pops head into frame
C: BONNIE HOPPS
D: Oh my sweet heaven-- Judy, are you a meter maid?
E: a discovery
N: Hopps is still wearing her vest, and her hat is on the chair.
C: HOPPS
D: Oh this? No! Oh, no no! This is just a temporary thing--
E: panicked
C: BONNIE HOPPS
D: It's the safest job on the force!
C: STU HOPPS
D: Ah, she's not a real cop! Our prayers have been answered!
C: BONNIE HOPPS
D: Glorious day!
C: STU HOPPS
D: Meter maid, meter maid!
C: HOPPS
D: Dad! Dad--
C: STU HOPPS
D: Meter maid, meter maid!
C: HOPPS
D: DAD! You know what-- it's been a really long day, I should really--
C: BONNIE HOPPS
D: That's right. You get some rest!
C: STU HOPPS
D: Those meters aren't gonna maid themselves. 30.
C: BONNIE HOPPS
D: Bye bye!
C: HOPPS
D: Buh-bye.
E: eye roll
N: She hangs up, defeated. The SELF-PITYING MUSIC comes up full.
C: ORYX POOTOSSER
D: Hey Bunny! Turn down that depressing music!
E: O.S.
C: KUDU POOTOSSER
D: Leave the meter maid alone! Didn't you hear her conversation? She feels like a failure!
E: O.S.
N: Judy turns off the music.
C: ORYX POOTOSSER
D: Oh, shut up!
E: O.S.
C: KUDU POOTOSSER
D: You shut up!
E: O.S.
C: ORYX POOTOSSER
D: You shut up!
E: O.S.
C: HOPPS
D: Tomorrow's another day...
E: quietly to herself
C: ORYX POOTOSSER
D: Yeah, but it might be worse!
E: O.S.
N: Off Judy's exhausted look, we:
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. STREETS OF ZOOTOPIA - THE NEXT DAY
N: Hopps, on meter maid duty, thunks a ticket on a windshield.
C: MOOSE
D: I was 30 seconds over!
N: Another meter dings, Hopps puts another ticket on a very small windshield.
C: ANGRY GERBIL LADY
D: Ugh! Yeah you're a real hero, lady! 31.
N: DING! Another ticket down. A MOTHER HIPPO picks up the ticket, her SMALL CHILD looks right at Hopps.
C: HIPPO CHILD
D: My mommy says she wishes you were dead.
C: ANGRY DRIVER
D: Un-cool, rabbit. My tax dollars pay your salary.
E: O.S.
S: INT. METER MAID CART
N: After what has clearly been a series of these encounters, Hopps repeatedly bangs her head on the steering wheel.
C: HOPPS
D: I am a real cop. I am a real cop. I am a real cop. I am a real cop...
E: less convinced with each utterance
C: FRANTIC PIG
D: Hey!
E: O.S.
N: Suddenly, a PIG bangs on the cart's window. Hopps startles.
C: FRANTIC PIG
D: You! Bunny!
E: CONT'D
C: HOPPS
D: Sir, if you have a grievance, you may contest your citation in traffic court.
E: rote
C: FRANTIC PIG
D: What're you talking about? My shop! It was just robbed! Look, he's getting away! Well are you a cop or not?
N: Hopps sees a WEASEL running with a bag of stolen goods.
C: HOPPS
D: Oh, yes! Yes! Don't worry, sir, I got this!
E: snapping out of it
S: EXT. STREETS OF ZOOTOPIA - CONTINUOUS
N: Hopps jumps out and gives chase-- ditching her silly vest.
C: HOPPS
D: Stop! Stop in the name of the law!
C: DUKE WEASELTON
D: Catch me if you can, Cottontail!
N: The chase is on. McHorn screeches up in his cop car.
C: DUKE WEASELTON
D: Whoa. Coming through!
E: CONT'D
C: MCHORN
D: This is Officer McHorn, we got a 10- 31.
N: Hopps slides across his hood.
C: HOPPS
D: I got dibs! Officer Hopps, I am in pursuit!
N: Hopps chases the Weasel, who races through Savannah Central. As Hopps advances, the Weasel ducks into... LITTLE RODENTIA. Thanks to her small size, Hopps follows him in.
C: HOPPS
D: You! Freeze!
E: CONT'D
C: MCHORN
D: Hey! Metermaid! Wait for the real cops!
E: arriving, but too big to enter
S: EXT. LITTLE RODENTIA - CONTINUOUS
N: Hopps emerges in Little Rodentia, teeming with tiny rodents.
C: HOPPS
D: Stop!
N: Hopps spots the Weasel, who's using two mouse cars as skates. She chases after him, smashing through Little Rodentia. As the Weasel jumps off the top of a mouse building, he knocks it over, but Hopps is able to save them from crashing. Resuming the chase, Hopps jumps off the building-- landing precariously in the midst of a large group of mice.
C: HOPPS
D: Oh! Oh, sorry! Coming through! `Scuse me! `Scuse me. Pardon... 33.
E: CONT'D
N: Hopps locates Weaselton, who's safely making his escape on the top of a tiny mouse train.
C: DUKE WEASELTON
D: Bon voyage, flat foot!
N: But Hopps won't quit. She takes a short cut and knocks him off the train. Rodents scream and run amidst the chaos.
C: HOPPS
D: Hey! Stop right there!
N: The Weasel throws an ornamental donut at Hopps.
C: DUKE WEASELTON
D: Have a donut, coppah!
N: But the donut misses and rolls towards some SHREWS coming out of "Mousies."
C: FRU FRU SHREW
D: Ohmygawd, did you see those leopard print jeggings? Aaaaaaaaaaaagh!
E: sees the donut about to kill her
N: But at the last second... Hopps stops it! Deep breath...
C: HOPPS
D: I love your hair.
C: FRU FRU SHREW
D: Aw... thank you.
N: Meanwhile, the Weasel spots the bag he was stealing and smugly picks it up, ready to leave.
C: DUKE WEASELTON
D: Come to papa...
N: Then out of nowhere, Hopps dumps the donut on his head.
S: INT. ZPD - LOBBY - A LITTLE LATER
N: The lobby is overflowing with ANIMALS filing MISSING MAMMAL REPORTS. Clawhauser is dealing with an otter, MRS. OTTERTON.
C: CLAWHAUSER
D: Okay, you're gonna have to be patient and wait in line just like everyone else, Mrs. Otterton, okay? 34.
N: Just then: BAM! The Weasel (in donut) rolls through the front door and hits Clawhauser's desk. It settles, revealing Hopps.
C: HOPPS
D: I popped the weasel!
N: Behind her, Chief Bogo yells from the second floor.
C: BOGO
D: HOPPS!
S: INT. ZPD - BOGO'S OFFICE - A LITTLE LATER
N: Hopps sits in a big chair in front of Bogo, like a kid in the principal's office. Bogo looks over a report.
C: BOGO
D: Abandoning your post, inciting a scurry, reckless endangerment of rodents... but to be fair, you did stop a master criminal from stealing two dozen... moldy onions.
C: HOPPS
D: Hate to disagree with you, sir, but those aren't onions. Those are a crocus varietal called Midnicampum Holicithias. They're a Class C Botanical, sir. I grew up in a family where plant husbandry was kind of a thing.
C: BOGO
D: Shut your tiny mouth, now.
C: HOPPS
D: Sir, I got the bad guy. That's my job.
C: BOGO
D: Your job is putting tickets on parked cars.
C: CLAWHAUSER
D: Chief, uh, Mrs. Otterton's here to see you again.
E: INTERCOM
C: BOGO
D: Not now. 35.
C: CLAWHAUSER
D: Okay, I just didn't know if you wanted to take it this time, she seems really upset--
E: INTERCOM
C: BOGO
D: Not now!
C: HOPPS
D: Sir, I don't want to be a meter maid... I wanna be a real cop.
C: BOGO
D: Do you think the Mayor asked what I wanted when he assigned you to me?
C: HOPPS
D: But sir, if you--
C: BOGO
D: Life isn't some cartoon musical where you sing a little song and your insipid dreams magically come true. So let it go!
N: MRS. OTTERTON barges in, with Clawhauser trailing, wheezing.
C: MRS. OTTERTON
D: Chief Bogo please-- five minutes of your time. Please...
C: CLAWHAUSER
D: I'm sorry, sir, I tried to stop her, she is super slippery. I gotta go sit down.
C: BOGO
D: Ma'am, as I've told you, we are doing everything we can...
C: MRS. OTTERTON
D: My husband has been missing for ten days. His name is Emmitt Otterton.
C: BOGO
D: Yes, I know.
C: MRS. OTTERTON
D: He's a florist. We have two beautiful children. He would never just disappear.
N: Mrs. Otterton reveals her own sweet little photo of Emmitt with her and the family.
C: BOGO
D: Ma'am, our detectives are very busy.
C: MRS. OTTERTON
D: Please. There's got to be somebody to find my Em.
C: BOGO
D: Mrs. Otterton--
C: HOPPS
D: I will find him.
E: O.S.
N: Mrs. Otterton races over to Hopps and gives her a big hug of relief. Bogo looks to Hopps, ready to explode.
C: MRS. OTTERTON
D: Oh, thank you! Bless you, bless you little bunny! Take this. Find my Emmitt. Bring him home to me and my babies. Please?
E: hands picture of family
N: Bogo grunts and ushers Mrs. Otterton back outside.
C: BOGO
D: Mrs. Otterton? Please wait out here.
C: MRS. OTTERTON
D: Of course. Oh, thank you both so much.
C: BOGO
D: One second.
N: He closes the door and turns to Hopps, furious.
C: BOGO
D: You're fired.
E: CONT'D
C: HOPPS
D: What? Why?!
C: BOGO
D: Insubordination. Now, I'm going to open this door and you're going to tell that otter you're a former meter maid with delusions of grandeur who will not be taking the case. 37.
N: Bogo opens the door, to find... Bellwether, hugging Mrs. Otterton.
C: BELLWETHER
D: I just heard Officer Hopps is taking the case!
C: BOGO
D: Assistant Mayor Bellwether...
C: BELLWETHER
D: The Mammal Inclusion Initiative is really starting to pay off! Mayor Lionheart is just gonna be so jazzed!
E: texting
C: BOGO
D: No! No, let's not tell the mayor just yet--
C: BELLWETHER
D: And I sent it, and it is done, so I did do that. All right, well I'd say the case is in good hands! Us little guys really need to stick together! Right?
C: HOPPS
D: Like glue!
C: BELLWETHER
D: Good one! Just call me if you ever need anything, okay? You've always got a friend at City Hall, Judy. Alright, bye bye!
E: amused laughter
C: HOPPS
D: Thank you, ma'am.
N: Bogo forces a smile and closes the door, even more pissed.
C: BOGO
D: I will give you 48 hours.
C: HOPPS
D: YES!
C: BOGO
D: That's two days to find Emmitt Otterton. 38.
C: HOPPS
D: Okay.
C: BOGO
D: But, you strike out-- you resign.
N: Hopps is taken aback by that for a moment... then nods.
C: HOPPS
D: Oh, uh... okay... deal.
C: BOGO
D: Splendid. Clawhauser will give you the complete case file.
S: INT. ZPD - DESK AREA - A LITTLE LATER
N: Clawhauser places the Otterton file on his desk for Hopps.
C: CLAWHAUSER
D: Here ya go! One missing otter!
N: Hopps opens the file. It's a single piece of paper. What?
C: HOPPS
D: That's it?!
C: CLAWHAUSER
D: Yikes! That is the smallest case file I've ever seen! Leads: none, witnesses: none-- and you're not in the computer system yet, so resources: none. I hope you didn't stake your career on cracking this one.
E: chuckles
N: Clawhauser takes a bite of his donut and the crumbs land on a picture in the file, drawing Hopps's attention to it.
C: HOPPS
D: Okay. "Last known sighting..."
E: deep breath
N: Hopps brushes away the crumbs, revealing a picture of Mr. Otterton on the street. Clawhauser annoyingly slurps from a soda bottle. Hopps squints at the picture, intrigued.
C: HOPPS Can I just borrow--
D: Thank you. 39.
E: CONT'D grabbing soda bottle
N: Hopps uses Clawhauser's bottle to enlarge the picture. She sees Mr. Otterton holding a PAWPSICLE.
C: HOPPS
D: Pawpsicle.
E: CONT'D
C: CLAWHAUSER
D: The murder weapon!
C: HOPPS
D: Get your pawpsicle...
C: CLAWHAUSER
D: Yeah, `cause that... What does that mean?
C: HOPPS
D: It means I... have a lead.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - LATER
N: We find Nick pushing a BABY STROLLER. HOPPS zooms up in her traffic cart, smiling.
C: HOPPS
D: Hi! Hello? It's me again!
C: NICK
D: Hey, it's Officer Toot Toot.
C: HOPPS
D: Ha-ha-ho, no actually it's Officer Hopps, and I'm here to ask you some questions about a case.
E: fake laugh, humoring him
C: NICK
D: What happened, meter maid? Did someone steal a traffic cone? It wasn't me.
N: Hopps looks ahead, Nick has gone around the corner. Hopps pulls in front of Nick and sounds her siren.
C: NICK
D: Hey, Carrots, you're gonna wake the baby, I gotta get to work. 40.
E: CONT'D
C: HOPPS
D: This is important, sir. I think your ten dollars worth of popsicles can wait.
C: NICK
D: I make 200 bucks a day, fluff. 365 days a year, since I was 12, and time is money, hop along.
C: HOPPS
D: Please, just look at the picture.
N: Hopps holds up the traffic cam picture of the Otter.
C: HOPPS
D: You sold Mr. Otterton that popsicle right? Do you know him?
E: CONT'D
C: NICK
D: I know everybody. And I also know that somewhere there's a toy store missing its stuffed animal, so why don't you get back to your box.
N: Hopps' ears droop.
C: HOPPS
D: Fine. Then we'll have to do this the hard way.
N: She puts a boot on the stroller.
C: NICK
D: Did you just boot my stroller?
C: HOPPS
D: Nicholas Wilde, you are under arrest.
C: NICK
D: For what? Howting your feewings?
C: HOPPS
D: Felony tax evasion.
N: Nick smile drops a bit.
C: HOPPS
D: Yeah. 200 dollars a day... 365 days a year... since you were 12, that's two decades, so times twenty... 41.
E: CONT'D calculating MORE
C: HOPPS
D: ...which is one million four- hundred sixty thousand-- I think, I mean I am just a dumb bunny, but we are good at multiplying-- anyway, according to your tax forms... ...you reported let me see here: zero. Unfortunately, lying on a federal form is a punishable offense. Five years jail time.
E: CONT'D presenting the forms
C: NICK
D: Well, it's my word against yours.
N: Hopps clicks a button on her CARROT PEN, which SPEAKS! NICK (ON CARROT PEN RECORDER) (CONT'D) "200 bucks a day, fluff. 365 days a year, since I was 12."
C: HOPPS
D: Actually, it's your word against yours. And if you want this pen, you're going to help me find this poor missing otter or the only place you'll be selling popsicles is the prison cafeteria. It's called a hustle, sweetheart.
E: dramatic smirk
N: Nick is utterly speechless.
C: FINNICK
D: She hustled you. She hustled you good! You're a cop now Nick, you're gonna need one of these! Have fun working with the fuzz!
E: rude laugh
N: THWAP! Finnick slaps his JUNIOR OFFICER STICKER on Nick.
C: HOPPS
D: Start talking.
C: NICK
D: I don't know where he is. I only saw where he went.
C: HOPPS
D: Great, let's go. 42.
C: NICK
D: It's not exactly a place for a cute little bunny.
C: HOPPS
D: Don't call me cute. Get in the car.
E: forceful
C: NICK
D: Okay. You're the boss.
S: INT. THE MYSTIC SPRING OASIS - LATER
N: The Mystic Spring Oasis is new agey, full of incense, etc. A meditating HIPPIE YAK sits with flies buzzing around his head, matching the tone of his ohm. Hopps enters with Nick and they approach the yak (still with his eyes closed).
C: YAX THE HIPPIE YAK
D: Oooooooooohmmmmmmmm. Oooooooooooohmmmmmm.
C: HOPPS
D: Hi, hello.
N: The yak continues his incessant chanting.
C: HOPPS
D: Um, hello? Hello? HELLO?!
E: CONT'D
N: The yak finally shakes out of his trance and notices Hopps.
C: HOPPS
D: Hello! My name is--
E: CONT'D
C: YAX THE HIPPIE YAK
D: Ooo, you know, I'm gonna hit the pause button right there, `cause we're all good on Bunny Scout Cookies.
C: HOPPS
D: Uh, no... I'm Officer Hopps, ZPD. I'm looking for a missing mammal, Emmitt Otterton. Right here-- --who may have frequented this establishment.
E: shows photo
N: The Yak looks at Hopps' picture. His eyes go wide, as if he's about to say something really important, and then:
C: YAX THE HIPPIE YAK AH-CHOO!
D: Yeah, Ol' Emmitt! Haven't seen him in a couple weeks. But hey, you should talk to his yoga instructor, I'd be happy to take you back.
E: flies go everywhere
C: HOPPS
D: Oh, thank you so much, I'd appreciate that more than you can imagine. It would be such a big-- You are naked!
E: scream
N: The Yak comes around the counter and he IS naked.
C: YAX THE HIPPIE YAK
D: Huh? Oh for sure, we're a naturalist club.
C: NICK
D: Yeah, in Zootopia anyone can be anything. These guys... they be naked.
N: Nick grins, Hopps isn't pleased.
C: YAX THE HIPPIE YAK
D: Nangi's just on the other side of the pleasure pool.
N: The Yak opens the doors to a POOL AREA, with tons of naked animals sunning themselves, playing in the pool, etc. Hopps' eyes nearly pop out of her head. Nick leans in.
C: NICK
D: Does this make you uncomfortable? Because, if so, there's no shame in calling it quits.
C: HOPPS
D: Yes there is.
C: NICK
D: Boy, that's the spirit.
S: EXT. NATURALIST CLUB - COURTYARD - MOMENTS LATER
N: Nick revels in Hopps' discomfort over the nude animals everywhere. Lots of nude animals. Yax leads them, oblivious.
C: YAX THE HIPPIE YAK
D: Yeah, some mammals say the naturalist life is weird, but you know what I say is weird? Clothes on animals! Here we go.
N: Nangi's engaging in a string of fairly evocative yoga poses. YAX THE HIPPIE YAK (CONT'D) As you can see, Nangi's an elephant, so she'll totally remember everything. Hey Nangi, these dudes have some questions about Emmitt the Otter.
C: NANGI
D: Who?
C: YAX
D: Uh, Emmitt Otterton? Been coming to your yoga class for like 6 years?
C: NANGI
D: I have no memory of this beaver.
C: JUDY
D: He's an otter actually.
C: YAX
D: He was here a couple Wednesdays ago. `Member?
C: NANGI
D: Nope.
C: YAX
D: Yeah, he was wearing a green cable- knit sweater vest, and new pair of corduroy slacks. Oh, and a paisley tie. Sweet Windsor knot. Real tight. Remember that Nangi?
C: NANGI
D: No.
N: Nangi doesn't want to be bothered. And she's useless. Yax is a gold mine, though! Hopps writes down everything he says.
C: YAX
D: Yeah, and we both walked him out and he got into this big ol' white car with a silver trim? Needed a tune up. The third cylinder wasn't firing. `Member that, Nangi? 45.
C: NANGI
D: Nope.
C: HOPPS
D: You didn't happen to catch the license plate number, did you?
C: YAX
D: Oh, for sure. It was 29THD03.
C: HOPPS
D: 0, 3... Wow, this is a lot of great info, thank you.
C: YAX
D: Told ya Nangi has a mind like a steel trap. I wish I had a memory like an elephant.
S: EXT. SAHARA SQUARE - MOMENTS LATER
N: Nick and Hopps emerge.
C: NICK
D: Well, I had a ball. You are welcome for the clue. And seeing as how any moron can run a plate, I will take that pen and bid you adieu.
N: As Nick reaches to take it, Hopps realizes something and leaves him hanging.
C: HOPPS
D: The plate... I can't run a plate... I'm not in the system yet.
E: frustrated grunt
C: NICK
D: Give me the pen please.
N: Hopps gets an idea...
C: HOPPS
D: What was it you said? "Any moron can run a plate?" Gosh... if only there were a moron around who were up to the task...
E: still withholding pen
C: NICK
D: Rabbit, I did what you asked, you can't keep me on the hook forever. 46.
C: HOPPS
D: Not forever. Why, I only have 36 hours left to solve this case. So can you run the plate or not?
C: NICK
D: Actually, I just remembered I have a pal at the DMV...
S: EXT. DMV - LATER
N: They arrive at the DMV, the "Department of Mammal Vehicles."
C: NICK
D: Flash is the fastest guy in there, you need something done, he's on it.
C: HOPPS
D: I hope so, we are really fighting the clock and every minute counts. Wait. They're all sloths?!
E: suddenly stops, alarmed
N: Unfortunately, every mammal working there is a... SLOTH. INSERT: SLOTH EMPLOYEES taking extraordinary amounts of time to do the simplest of tasks-- stapling, stamping, etc.
C: HOPPS
D: You said this was going to be quick!
E: CONT'D
C: NICK
D: What? Are you saying that because he's a sloth, he can't be fast? I thought in Zootopia anyone could be anything.
E: faux innocence
N: Nick smiles. Hopps doesn't. They head to Flash's station.
C: NICK
D: Flash, Flash, hundred yard dash! Buddy, it's nice to see ya.
E: CONT'D
N: Flash doesn't respond. Beat.
C: FLASH
D: Nice to... see you... too. 47.
E: beat beat beat beat

C: NICK
D: Hey Flash, I'd love ya to meet my friend-- uh, darlin' I've forgotten your name.
C: HOPPS
E: fake smile, to Nick
C: Officer Judy Hopps, ZPD.
D: How are ya?
E: shows badge
N: Flash doesn't respond... then...
C: FLASH
D: I am... doing... just...

E: to an impatient Hopps
C: FLASH
D: ...can I... do...
C: HOPPS
D: Well, I was hoping you could run a plate--
C: FLASH
D: For you...
C: HOPPS
D: Well, I was hoping you could--
C: FLASH
D: ...today.
N: Hopps pauses-- cautiously optimistic that he's finished.
C: HOPPS
D: Well, I was hoping you could run a plate for us. We are in a really big hurry.
N: Beat. Beat.
C: FLASH
D: Sure. What's the... plate...
C: HOPPS
D: 2, 9, T--

C: NICK
D: Hey Flash, wanna hear a joke?
C: HOPPS
D: No! 49.
C: FLASH
D: Sure.
C: NICK
D: What do you call a three humped camel?
C: FLASH I don't... know...
D: What... do... you call... a...
E: beat
C: HOPPS
D: Three humped camel.
C: FLASH
D: Three humped... camel?
C: NICK
D: Pregnant.
N: Nick laughs at his own joke. Flash doesn't react, then finally raises his head with a smile and....
C: FLASH
D: Ha... ha... ha... ha...
C: HOPPS
D: Ha, ha, yes very funny, very funny, can we please just focus on the task--
N: Flash slowly reaches over to the sloth next to him.
C: FLASH
D: Hey... Priscilla...
C: HOPPS
D: Oh no!
C: PRISCILLA
D: Yes... Flash?
C: FLASH
D: What... do...
C: HOPPS
D: No!

D: You call... a... 50.
C: HOPPS
D: A three humped camel? Pregnant! Okay, great, we got it, please just-
C: FLASH
D: Three... humped...
C: HOPPS
D: Aggggggghhhhhhh--
S: INT. DMV - LATER
N: A slow DOT-MATRIX printer spits out the address for CAR LICENSE PLATE NUMBER: 29THD03.
C: FLASH
D: Here...
C: HOPPS
D: Yeah, yeah, yeah... thank you!
C: FLASH
D: You... go.
C: HOPPS
E: frantically reads
C: 29THD03-- it's registered to...
D: Tundratown Limo Service? A limo took Otterton, and the limo's in Tundratown-- it's in Tundratown!
C: NICK
D: Way to hustle, bud. I love ya. I owe ya.
C: HOPPS
D: Hurry, we gotta beat the rush hour and--
S: EXT. DMV - CONTINUOUS
N: They go outside. It's night.
C: HOPPS
D: IT'S NIGHT?!
S: EXT. SNOWY LOT - MOMENTS LATER
N: Nick and Hopps reach LEGITIMATE ENTERPRISE CAR SERVICE. Hopps tries to open the lock.
C: HOPPS
D: Closed. Great.
C: NICK
D: Mm. And I will betcha you don't have a warrant to get in. Hm? Darn it. It's a bummer.
N: There's a big gated parking lot which is chained shut... but they can see a few limos parking inside, covered in snow.
C: HOPPS
D: You wasted the day on purpose.
C: NICK
D: Madam, I have a fake badge. I would never impede your pretend investigation.
C: HOPPS
D: It's not a pretend investigation! Look, see-- See him? This otter is missing.
E: showing picture of Otterton
C: NICK
D: Well then they should have gotten a real cop to find him.
C: HOPPS
D: What is your problem? Does seeing me fail somehow make you feel better about your own sad, miserable life?
N: Nick considers this for a moment.
C: NICK
D: It does. One hundred percent. Now... since you're sans warrant, I guess we're done?
E: then
N: Hopps considers this and sighs, defeated.
C: HOPPS
D: Fine. We are done. Here's your pen.
N: Hopps then casually throws it over the fence behind her.
C: NICK
D: Hey! 52.
E: staring at the pen MORE
C: NICK
D: First off, you throw like a bunny, second, you're a very sore loser. See ya later, Officer Fluff, so sad this is over, I wish I could've helped more.
E: CONT'D starts to climb
N: Nick jumps down onto the other side, but just as he reaches for the pen, Hopps is suddenly right there and snatches it.
C: HOPPS
D: The thing is, you don't need a warrant if you have probable cause, and I'm pretty sure I saw a shifty low-life climbing the fence, so you're helping plenty. Come on.
N: Hopps cheerfully heads off. Nick watches her, not quite smiling, but he's starting to respect his opponent.
S: EXT. PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER
N: Hopps wipes snow off a back bumper: LICENSE PLATE 29THD03.
C: HOPPS
D: 29THD03... this is it.
S: INT. REFRIGOUSINE - MOMENTS LATER
N: They open the big door, which looks like it belongs on a refrigerator. As they snoop around, Hopps uses tweezers to pick up a clump of fur.
C: HOPPS
D: Polar bear fur.
C: NICK
D: OH MY GOD!
E: opening glove box
C: HOPPS
D: What? What?!
N: Hopps looks up, only to see Nick holding some JERRY VOLE CDs.
C: NICK
D: The Velvety Pipes of Jerry Vole! But on CD? Who still uses CDs?
N: As Hopps rolls her eyes and goes back to collecting clues, Nick lowers the back partition and his eyes go wide.
C: NICK
D: Carrots...? If your otter was here... he had a very bad day.
E: CONT'D
N: Hopps' flashlight reveals CLAW MARKS covering the back seat.
C: HOPPS
D: Those are... claw marks. You ever seen anything like this?
C: NICK
D: No.
N: Through the fog on the floor Hopps spots a wallet.
C: HOPPS
D: Oh, wait. Look.
N: They slink back into the back seat. Hopps opens up the wallet to find a drivers license for Mr. Otterton.
C: HOPPS
D: This is him. Emmitt Otterton. He was definitely here. What do you think happened?
E: CONT'D
N: Nick spots a cocktail glass... it's etched with a "B."
C: NICK
D: Well, now wait a minute... Polar bear fur... Rat Pack music... fancy cup... I know whose car this is. We gotta go!
E: then, suspicious suddenly terrified
C: HOPPS
D: Why? Whose car is it?
N: Nick tries to put everything back the way he found it.
C: NICK
D: The most feared crime boss in Tundratown. They call him Mr. Big and he does not like me, so we gotta go!
C: HOPPS
D: I'm not leaving, this is a crime scene. 54.
C: NICK
D: Well, it's gonna be an even bigger crime scene if Mr. Big finds me here, so we're leaving right now!
N: Nick ushers Hopps to the door, but opens it to find two big POLAR BEARS.
C: NICK
D: Raymond! And, is that Kevin?! Long time no see. And speaking of no see, how about you forget you saw me? Huh? For old time's sake?
E: CONT'D faux excitement
N: The polar bears grab Nick and Hopps by their throats...
C: NICK
D: That's a no.
E: CONT'D
N: ...and yank them off screen.
S: INT. POLAR BEAR CAR - MOMENTS LATER
N: VROOM! A car whizzes by. Inside, Nick and Hopps sit nervously in the back seat, sandwiched between the polar bears-- one of whom casually scrolls through Zoogle Photos on his phone.
C: HOPPS
D: What did you do that made Mr. Big so mad at you?
C: NICK
D: I uh, I may have sold him a very expensive wool rug... that was made from the fur of a... skunk's butt.
E: sotto
C: HOPPS
D: Oh, sweet cheese and crackers.
E: pissed at Nick
N: Pull out to reveal the car passing through the security gate of a residential compound. A POLAR BEAR GUARD lets them in.
S: INT. MR. BIG'S RESIDENCE - MOMENTS LATER
N: Nick and Hopps are shoved into a room that's right out of The Godfather. A POLAR BEAR enters...
C: HOPPS
D: Is that Mr. Big?
E: sotto
C: NICK
D: No.
E: sotto
N: Now an even BIGGER POLAR BEAR enters...
C: HOPPS
D: What about him? Is that him?
C: NICK
D: No.
E: sotto, frustrated
N: ...and then another. The BIGGEST POLAR BEAR yet...
C: HOPPS
D: That's gotta be him.
C: NICK
D: Stop talking stop talking stop talking--
N: The huge polar bear growls at Nick, then reveals a tiny chair upon which sits... a TEENY, TINY ARCTIC SHREW... this is MR. BIG. He sounds like Marlon Brando sped up to 78 rpm.
C: NICK
D: Mr. Big, sir, this is a simple misunder-
E: CONT'D
N: Mr. Big holds out a TINY FINGER for NICK to KISS HIS RING. Nick painstakingly does so.
C: NICK
D: This is a simple misunderstanding.
E: CONT'D
N: Mr. Big motions for Nick to shut up.
C: MR. BIG
D: You come here unannounced... on the day my daughter is to be married?
C: NICK
D: Well actually we were brought here against our will, so... Point is, I did not know it was your car, and I certainly did not know about your daughter's wedding. 56.
E: Mr. Big is not impressed
C: MR. BIG
D: I trusted you, Nicky... I welcomed you into my home... we broke bread together... Gram-mama made you her cannoli. And how did you repay my generosity? With a rug... made from the butt of a skunk. A skunk butt rug. You disrespected me. You disrespected my gram-mama who I buried in that skunk butt rug. I told you never to show your face here again, but here you are, snooping around with this... What are you, a performer? What's with the costume?
E: re. Hopps
C: HOPPS
D: Sir, I am a c--
C: NICK
D: Mime! She is a mime. This mime, cannot speak. You can't speak if you're a mime.
C: HOPPS
D: No. I am a cop. And I'm on the Emmitt Otterton case, and my evidence puts him in your car, so intimidate me all you want, I'm going to find out what you did to that otter if it's the last thing I do.
N: Mr. Big considers this and makes that little grunt.
C: MR. BIG
D: Then I have only one request: say hello to Gram-mama. Ice `em!
N: The Polar Bears snatch Nick and Hopps.
C: NICK
D: Whoa-- I didn't see nothing-- I'm not saying nothing--
C: MR. BIG
D: And you never will--
N: The polar bears open a hidden door on the floor, revealing an icy pool beneath.
C: NICK
D: Please! No no no! If you're mad at me about the rug I've got more rugs!
N: Nick and Hopps are about to be dumped in, when--
C: FRU FRU SHREW
D: Oh, Daddy, it's time for our dance. What did we say? No icing anyone at my wedding!
E: sees them trying to kill Nick
C: MR. BIG
D: I have to, baby. Daddy has to. Ice `em.
E: to Thugs
N: Nick and Hopps scream and--
C: FRU FRU SHREW
D: Wait. WAIT! She's the bunny that saved my life yesterday. From that giant donut.
C: MR. BIG
D: This bunny?
C: FRU FRU SHREW
D: Yeah. Hi!
C: HOPPS
D: Hi. I love your dress.
E: warm, whisper
C: FRU FRU SHREW
D: Aw, thank you.
N: Mr. Big motions for the Polar Bears to put Hopps down.
C: MR. BIG
D: Put `em down. You have done me a great service. I will help you find the otter. I will take your kindness... and pay it forward.
E: then, to Hopps
N: Hopps and Mr. Big kiss on the cheeks. Nick stares at them... What is happening?
S: INT. WEDDING RECEPTION - A LITTLE LATER
N: A lavish celebration full of arctic animals dancing. We find Nick and Hopps at the head table, next to Mr. Big. They all eat TINY pieces of WEDDING CAKE.
C: MR. BIG
D: Otterton is my florist. He's like a part of the family. He had something important he wanted to discuss. That's why I sent that car to pick him up. But he never arrived.
C: HOPPS
D: Because he was attacked.
C: MR. BIG
D: No... he attacked.
C: HOPPS
D: Otterton?
C: MR. BIG
D: Otterton. He went crazy. Ripped up the car, scared my driver half to death and disappeared into the night.
C: HOPPS
D: He's a sweet little otter.
C: MR. BIG
D: My child, we may be evolved... but deep down we are still animals.
N: Nick and Hopps trade a worried glance. OVER THE FOLLOWING WE CROSS-DISSOLVE TO NICK AND HOPPS WALKING IN THE RAINFOREST:
C: MR. BIG
D: You want to find Otterton... talk to the driver of the car. His name's Manchas, lives in the Rainforest District. Only he can tell you more.
E: V.O. CONT'D
S: EXT. "RAINFOREST DISTRICT" - LATER THAT NIGHT
N: Nick and Hopps make their way across a mossy rope bridge high above the forest floor. It leads to a moss-covered apartment.
S: EXT. "THE CANOPY" - MOMENTS LATER
N: At the door of the DRIVER'S APARTMENT, they ring the bell.
C: HOPPS
D: Mr. Manchas? Judy Hopps, ZPD. We just want to know what happened to Emmitt Otterton.
N: Beat. The door creaks open.
C: MANCHAS
D: You should be asking... what happened to me.
E: MUFFLED INSIDE
N: The door opens to the chain, revealing... MANCHAS is... a HUGE JAGUAR-- but he's been badly beaten up. He has a black eye, and a scratches. Nick and Hopps are taken aback.
C: NICK
D: Whoa. A teensy otter... did that?
C: HOPPS
D: What... happened?
N: Off Manchas's look, we
T: CUT TO:
N: A FLASHBACK -- Manchas is driving when he's attacked from the back seat.
C: MANCHAS
D: He was an animal... down on all fours... he was a savage.
E: THROUGH DOOR GAP
N: The car spins out. Emmitt growls at Manchas then runs off. BACK TO: THE CANOPY --
C: MANCHAS
D: There was no warning, he just kept yelling about the "night howlers." Over and over, "the night howlers..."
E: haunted
N: Nick and Hopps share a subtle look-- they have no idea what "night howlers" are.
C: NICK
D: Oh. So you know about the night howlers too? Good, good, good. Because the night howlers are exactly what we are here to talk about. Right?
E: to Judy
C: HOPPS
D: Yep. So, uh, you just open the door and tell us what you know and we will tell you what we know. Okay?
C: MANCHAS
D: Okay.
E: considering
N: Manchas closes the door and starts to unlock a series of deadbolts. Judy gives Nick an impressed look.
C: HOPPS
D: Clever fox.
N: There's a commotion inside, followed by a scream.
C: HOPPS
D: Mr. Manchas?
E: CONT'D
N: The door creaks open just an inch. Nick and Hopps seem startled... Hopps slowly pushes the door open, revealing Manchas in the center of the room, hunched over and grunting.
C: NICK
D: Buddy?
C: HOPPS
D: Are you... okay?
N: Hopps looks at Manchas. RAAAGH!!! Manchas turns, right at them. His eyes are dilated, he's turned savage! He's poised to pounce on Nick and Hopps.
C: HOPPS
D: Run. RUN!
E: CONT'D
N: The Jaguar tears after them, he's deranged, primal. Nick and Hopps run! The jaguar is closing in.
C: NICK
D: What is wrong with him?! 61.
C: HOPPS
D: I don't know!!
N: Nick and Hopps run across the bridge. Manchas closes in.
C: HOPPS
D: Jump!
E: CONT'D
N: They jump off the bridge to a lower branch. They duck into a hollow log and Manchas follows them.
C: HOPPS
D: Head down!
E: CONT'D to Nick
N: Hopps frantically picks up her police radio.
C: HOPPS
D: Officer Hopps to dispatch!
E: CONT'D
S: INT. POLICE STATION - DISPATCH - SAME
N: We find Clawhauser showing a handcuffed PERP a video on his phone of pop star Gazelle singing and dancing. A RED LIGHT blinks on the desk phone, but Clawhauser ignores it.
C: CLAWHAUSER
D: Are you familiar with Gazelle? Greatest singer of our lifetime-- angel with horns-- okay, hold on, keep watching. Who's that beside her? Who is it?
N: Reveal: Clawhauser is dancing on stage with Gazelle.
C: GAZELLE
D: Wow, you are one hot dancer... ...BENJAMIN CLAWHAUSER.
E: ON PHONE digitized robo-voice
C: CLAWHAUSER
D: It's me! Did you think it was real? It looks so real! It's not. It's just a new app. Hold on a second--
E: joyous laughter finally notices ringing phone
N: Clawhauser clicks the speaker button and--
C: HOPPS CLAWHAUSER!
D: Blue Rev. 62.
E: V.O. mm/dd/yy
S: EXT. THE CANOPY - SAME
N: RAAGH! Manchas takes a swipe at Nick.
C: HOPPS
D: Clawhauser, listen to me! We have a 10-91! Jaguar gone savage! Vine and Tu-junja!
C: NICK
D: It's Tujunga!
N: As they emerge from the log, Hopps slips, dropping her radio.
C: CLAWHAUSER
D: Okay, we're sending back up! Hopps? HOPPS?!
E: ON RADIO
N: Nick and Hopps run, sliding around a corner. Ahead is a gondola station.
C: HOPPS
D: There! Head to the skytrams!
N: They run to the gondolas. Hopps darts out of Manchas' way, but slips and is headed off the platform when she manages to grab on-- dangling from the edge. Nick searches for her...
C: NICK
D: Get in! Carrots? Carrots!
N: He tries to hold on to the gondola for Hopps, who is struggling to pull herself back onto the platform.
C: HOPPS
D: Go!
N: As the gondola pulls away, Nick tries to stop it to no avail.
C: NICK
D: No, no, no!
N: Nick backs up... the jaguar stalks him.
C: NICK
D: Buddy, one predator to another-- *
E: CONT'D
N: The jaguar charges, but before it gets Nick-- clank! It's * yanked back in place. We see a HANDCUFF on its back paw, attached to a metal post. Hopps cuffed him!
C: NICK
D: Now, I can tell you're a little tense, so I'm just gonna give you a little personal space--
E: CONT'D
N: The jaguar thrashes, knocking Nick and Hopps over the edge. Hopps barely grabs a vine, but struggles to hold Nick in the other hand. As Manchas growls at them from above, Nick looks at the abyss below. Hopps looks around, her mind racing.
C: NICK
D: Rabbit, whatever you do, do not let go!
E: CONT'D
C: HOPPS
D: I'm gonna let go!
C: NICK
D: No, you what? No, I said-- listen-- noooo!
C: HOPPS
D: One, two--
N: Hopps lets go, swinging them over to a netting of vines, kind of on top of each other. They can't believe they're alive. They look at each other, stunned, relieved...
C: NICK
D: Carrots. You saved my life.
C: HOPPS
D: Well. That's what we do at the
C: ZP...
D: Deeeeeeeeeeeee.....
E: the branch snaps
N: Nick and Hopps plummet. They are about to hit the ground, but a vine attached to their legs stops them right before impact. Woo! A convoy of police arrive, screeching in front of them. Out steps... Bogo. Hopps smiles, the cavalry has arrived.
C: BOGO
D: Well, this should be good.
N: MOMENTS LATER -- Hopps leads the cops up to the canopy, full of confidence.
C: HOPPS
D: I thought this was just a missing mammal case, but it's way bigger. 64.
E: MORE
C: HOPPS
D: Mr. Otterton did not just disappear. I believe he and this jaguar, they... went savage, Sir.
E: CONT'D
C: BOGO
D: Savage? This isn't the Stone Age, Hopps. Animals don't go savage.
E: scoffing
C: HOPPS
D: I thought so too, `til I saw this:
N: Hopps pulls back some leaves to reveal: the jaguar is gone. There is no sign of him... or his handcuffs. It's like it never happened. Hopps' eyes go wide.
C: HOPPS
D: What? He was right here...
E: CONT'D
C: BOGO
D: The "savage" jaguar.
E: not buying it
C: HOPPS
D: Sir, I know what I saw-- he almost killed us.
C: BOGO
D: Or maybe any aggressive predator looks savage to you rabbits. Let's go.
E: calls out, to cops
C: HOPPS
D: Wait-- Sir, I'm not the only one who saw him! Nick!
E: to Nick
N: Hopps turns to Nick, but before he can explain:
C: BOGO
D: You think I'm going to believe a fox?
E: incredulous
C: HOPPS
D: Well he was a key witness and I enlisted--
C: BOGO
D: Two days to find the otter... 65.
E: the last straw MORE
C: BOGO
D: or you quit... that was the deal. Badge.
E: CONT'D
N: Bogo extends his arm, waiting for Hopps to hand it over.
C: HOPPS
D: But, Sir, we...
C: BOGO
D: Badge.
N: Hopps looks at Bogo, then looks at her badge, she's about to reach for it, when...
C: NICK
D: Uh, no.
E: O.S.
N: Bogo stops, and glares at Nick.
C: BOGO
D: What did you say, fox?
C: NICK
D: Sorry, what I said was, "no." She will not be giving you that badge. Look, you gave her a clown vest and a three-wheel joke-mobile and two days to solve a case you guys haven't cracked in two weeks? Yeah, no wonder she needed to get help from a fox, none of you guys were gonna help her, were you?
N: Hopps looks at Nick, stunned he's sticking up for her.
C: NICK
D: Here's the thing Chief, you gave her the 48 hours, so technically we still have 10 left to find our Mr. Otterton... and that's exactly what we're gonna do, so if you'll excuse us... we have a very big lead to follow and a case to crack. Good day.
E: CONT'D
N: Nick guides Hopps to a PASSING GONDOLA, motioning her in.
C: NICK
D: Officer Hopps?
E: CONT'D
N: The gondola pulls away, leaving Bogo and the rest of the police watching, flabbergasted.
S: INT./EXT. GONDOLA - CONTINUOUS
N: Hopps and Nick both stare straight ahead.
C: HOPPS
D: Thank you.
C: NICK
D: Never let `em see that they get to you.
N: Hopps looks at Nick, a little surprised. Nick looks out.
C: HOPPS
D: So, things do get to you...
C: NICK
D: No... I mean, not anymore. But I was small and emotionally unbalanced like you once.
C: HOPPS
D: Har-har.
C: NICK
D: No, it's true. I think was 8, or maybe 9, and all I wanted to do was join the Junior Ranger Scouts.
E: retreating into the memory
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. YOUNG NICK'S BEDROOM - DUSK (FLASHBACK)
N: YOUNG NICK, tiny and cherubic, looks in the mirror. We see MOTHER's paws tying the scout kerchief around his neck.
C: NICK
D: ...so, my mom scraped together enough money to buy me a brand new uniform because, by God, I was gonna fit in.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. SCOUT BUILDING - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
N: Young Nick bounds down the sidewalk and up the stairs.
C: NICK
D: Even if I was the only predator in the troop-- 67.
E: V.O.
S: INT. SCOUT MEETING - MOMENTS LATER (FLASHBACK)
N: Young Nick enters a church basement, spots a GROUP OF PREY KIDS, all in scout uniforms. They wave him over.
C: NICK
D: ...the only fox.
E: V.O. CONT'D
C: MEAN KID ANIMAL
D: Okay, Nick!
E: O.S.
C: NICK
D: I was gonna be part of a pack.
E: V.O.
C: MEAN KID ANIMAL
D: Ready for initiation?
C: YOUNG NICK
D: Yeah! Pretty much born ready.
N: They high five Nick. It looks promising and fun.
C: NICK
D: I was so proud.
E: V.O.
N: Suddenly, a BIG KID turns off the lights. Other KIDS switch on FLASHLIGHTS, shining them on Nick like gestapo spotlights.
C: MEAN KID ANIMAL
D: Okay. Now raise your right hand and deliver the oath.
C: YOUNG NICK
D: I, Nicholas Wilde, promise to be brave, loyal, helpful, and trustworthy.
C: MEAN KID ANIMAL
D: Even though you're a fox?
C: YOUNG NICK
D: What?
N: Then, a bunch of KID ANIMALS tackle Nick. Soon, all of the animals pile on, kicking and shoving him.
C: YOUNG NICK
D: No! What did I do wrong, you guys?! No! Please tell me, what did I do wrong?!
E: CONT'D
N: With Nick pinned, the primary mean kid straddles him. Someone hands him a MUZZLE. The mean kid snaps it on Nick's snout.
C: YOUNG NICK
D: What did I do?!
E: CONT'D muzzled
C: MEAN KID ANIMAL
D: If you thought we would ever trust a fox without a muzzle, you're even dumber than you look.
N: Nick breaks free from the kids. Scrambles away from them in fright. As they laugh, he races out the door. MEAN KID ANIMAL (O.S.) (CONT'D) Aw, is he gonna cry? Once out sight, Nick panics as he struggles to remove the muzzle. It won't come off. Finally-- painfully-- he pulls it off and throws it to the ground. He collapses, weeping. THE GONDOLA --
C: NICK
D: I learned two things that day. One, I was never gonna let anyone see that they got to me.
N: Hopps looks at Nick, who avoids eye contact.
C: HOPPS
D: ...And two?
C: NICK
D: If the world's only gonna see a fox as shifty and untrustworthy, there's no point in trying to be anything else.
C: HOPPS
D: Nick, you are so much more than that...
N: Hopps touches Nick's arm as the gondola pierces the clouds. The city at dawn comes into view. It's gotten too real for Nick. He abruptly changes the subject.
C: NICK
D: Boy, look at that traffic down there. How about we go out to Chuck in Traffic Central-- Chuck, how are things looking on the Jam Cams? 69.
E: putting on radio voice
C: HOPPS
D: Nick, I'm glad you told me...
C: NICK
D: The Jam Cams...!
E: lightbulb moment!
C: HOPPS
D: Seriously, it's okay...
C: NICK
D: No-n-shh-shush! There are traffic cameras everywhere. All over the canopy. Whatever happened to that jaguar--
C: HOPPS
D: The traffic cams would have caught it!
C: NICK
D: Bingo!
N: Hopps gives him a chuck on the arm, impressed.
C: HOPPS
D: Pretty sneaky, Slick.
C: NICK
D: However. If you didn't have access to the system before, I doubt Chief Buffalo Butt is gonna let you into it now.
C: HOPPS
D: No... But I have a friend at City Hall who might.
E: beat, then
S: INT. CITY HALL - LATER THAT MORNING
N: We find BELLWETHER trying to balance a stack of binders while struggling to keep pace with Mayor Lionheart, who is walking quickly in front of her.
C: BELLWETHER
D: Sir? If we could just review these very important-- Sir?
E: almost drops binders
N: She almost steps on a LITTLE MOUSE LADY.
C: BELLWETHER
D: Ooo, I'm so sorry... sir?!
E: CONT'D
C: LIONHEART
D: Okay. I heard you, Bellwether. Just take care of it! Please. And clear my afternoon, I'm going out.
E: setting another binder atop her stack
C: BELLWETHER
D: No, no! But, sir, you do have a meeting with Herds and Grazing... sir, if I could just--
N: He continues through a door. Bellwether tries to follow, but the door shuts on her, spilling the binders to the floor.
C: BELLWETHER
D: Oh, mutton chops.
E: CONT'D
N: As Bellwether picks up her mess, Hopps and Nick appear.
C: HOPPS
D: Assistant Mayor Bellwether? We need your help.
S: INT. BELLWETHER'S OFFICE - LATER
N: We're in Bellwether's cramped little office. Nick and Hopps hover over her while she sits at her computer.
C: HOPPS
D: We just need to get into the traffic cam database.
N: Nick subtly touches Bellwether's wool puff.
C: NICK
D: So fluffy!
E: mouths, to Hopps
C: HOPPS
D: Hey!
C: NICK
D: Sheep never let me this close.
C: HOPPS
D: You can't just touch a sheep's wool... 71.
C: NICK HOPPS
D: It's like cotton candy. Stop it!
E: CONT'D
N: Judy swats Nick, but accidentally hits Bellwether's puff.
C: BELLWETHER
D: Where to?
C: HOPPS
D: Rainforest District, Vine and Tujunga.
N: ANGLE ON the computer screen.
C: BELLWETHER
D: There! Traffic cams for the whole city. This is so exciting, actually. Well, you know, I never get to do anything this important.
C: HOPPS
D: But you're the Assistant Mayor of Zootopia.
C: BELLWETHER
D: Oh, I'm more of a glorified secretary. I think Mayor Lionheart just wanted the sheep vote... But he did give me that nice mug.
E: then, cheerily
N: She motions to a mug that reads World's Greatest Dad Assistant Mayor.
C: BELLWETHER
D: Feels good to be appreciated.
E: CONT'D
C: LIONHEART
D: Smellwether?!
E: INTERCOM
N: Bellwether cringes.
C: BELLWETHER
D: That's a fun little name he likes to use. I called him Lionfart once. He did not care for that, let me tell you. It was not a good day for me. Yes, sir?
E: pressing intercom button
C: LIONHEART
D: I thought you were going to cancel my afternoon?! 72.
E: INTERCOM
C: BELLWETHER
D: Oh, dear. I better go -- Let me know what you find. It was really nice for me to be--
E: to Hopps, while leaving
C: LIONHEART
D: While we're young, Smellwether!
E: INTERCOM
N: Bellwether finally opens her big heavy door and leaves.
C: NICK
D: You think when she goes to sleep she counts herself?
C: HOPPS
D: Shush. Okay, traffic cams... Tujunga, Tujunga... we're in.
E: looking at computer
N: Nick and Hopps watch the footage from the night before. We can see the jaguar going nuts. Then a BLACK VAN skids up, and some WOLVES hop out.
C: HOPPS
D: Who are these guys?
E: CONT'D
C: NICK
D: Timberwolves. Look at these dumdums.
N: The Wolves suddenly capture the jaguar with a net. Judy GASPS, shocked. Nick is unfazed.
C: NICK
D: Betcha a nickel one of em's gonna howl.
E: CONT'D
N: The wolves howl...
C: NICK
D: And there it is. What is it with wolves and the howling? It's like--
E: CONT'D
C: HOPPS
D: Howlers! Night howlers! That's what Manchas was afraid of... wolves! The wolves are the night howlers. If they took Manchas...
E: light-bulb moment
C: NICK
D: ...I bet they took Otterton too. 73.
C: HOPPS
D: All we gotta do is find out where they went.
N: She clicks the monitor... but as the wolves drive off, they disappear through a tunnel and don't come out the other side.
C: HOPPS
D: Wait. Where'd they go?
E: CONT'D
C: NICK
D: You know, if I wanted to avoid surveillance because I was doing something illegal-- which I never have-- I would use the maintenance tunnel 6B... which would put them out...
N: He clicks on another camera. Nothing... then... the wolves emerge in the van.
C: NICK
D: ...right there.
E: CONT'D
N: Hopps looks at Nick, impressed.
C: HOPPS
D: Well, look at you, Junior Detective. You know, I think you'd actually make a pretty good cop.
C: NICK
D: How dare you.
N: Hopps goes back to clicking... we track the wolves through alleys and back roads.
C: NICK
D: Acacia alley... Ficus underpass... South Canyon...
E: CONT'D
C: HOPPS
D: They're heading out of town... Where does that road go?
S: EXT. CLIFFSIDE ASYLUM - GOLDEN HOUR
N: The imposing CLIFFSIDE ASYLUM sits on the edge of a waterfall. Nick and Hopps, hidden on the side of the road, spy from a hundred yards away. Nick and Hopps sneak up to the guard gate, where TWO WOLVES are stationed. Using elaborate hand signals, Nick motions he's going to sneak past first. He gets around the gate, but as he gets close... a wolf sniffs the air... he's onto him. Nick reaches around and grabs a piece of wood to use as a weapon. The wolf moves toward Nick... but before he reaches him... Ooooooooooo! A distant howl grabs his attention. It's Hopps, cupping her mouth to make the howl sound distant. The wolf hears it and can't help but howl as well. Another guard approaches.
C: WOLF GUARD
D: Gary, quit it, you're gonna start a howl.
C: GARY THE WOLF GUARD I didn't start it.
D: Oooooooo!
E: more howling off-screen
C: WOLF GUARD
D: Oooooooooo!
N: More wolves start to howl. Nick looks at Hopps, impressed.
C: HOPPS
D: Come on!
N: Nick and Hopps use the distraction to jump the fence and sneak into the complex.
C: NICK
D: You are a clever bunny.
N: Above, they notice a drainage pipe leading into the building.
S: INT. CLIFFSIDE ASYLUM - LARGE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: Nick and Hopps emerge from the drain pipe into the creepy asylum. They're in a large, cavernous room, full of old MEDICAL EQUIPMENT. It's like a combination of an old hospital and a turn-of-the-century zoo.
C: HOPPS
D: It looks like this was a hospital.
N: Judy shines her light down a corridor, at the end of which is a metal door with a blue light shining within. Nick nears the door, about to open it... the tension builds and then...
C: NICK
D: You know, after you, you're the cop.
E: turns to Hopps
S: INT. CLIFFSIDE ASYLUM - MEDICAL WARD - MOMENTS LATER
N: Hopps cautiously pushes the door open to reveal: a room with modern medical equipment. Nick pops up behind her.
C: NICK
D: Okay. All clear.
N: Hopps rolls her eyes and cautiously enters and looks around.
C: HOPPS
D: All this equipment is brand new...
C: NICK
D: Carrots...?
E: O.S.
N: Nick points to the ground, which is scuffed with CLAW MARKS.
C: HOPPS
D: Claw marks...
C: NICK
D: Yeah. Huge, huge, claw marks. I mean, what kind of--
N: RAAGH! A SAVAGE TIGER emerges behind the glass of a nearby cage, startling Nick and sending him running to Hopps. Hopps swivels her flashlight to reveal: dozens of reflective eyes. Nick and Hopps make their way down a long corridor of cages, looking for the jaguar.
C: HOPPS
D: Mr. Manchas.
N: He's still feral, on all fours and pacing in a cell. They continue on, passing three, four, five, cages until finally, in the last cage: a FERAL OTTER. It's EMMITT OTTERTON.
C: HOPPS
D: It's him. We found our otter. Mr. Otterton, my name is Officer Judy Hopps. Your wife sent me to find you. We're gonna get you out of here now.
E: CONT'D to the otter, gently
N: Otterton screeches at her and lunges toward the glass.
C: NICK
D: Or not. Guess he's in no rush to get home to the Missus.
N: Hopps looks back down the corridor of cells, counting.
C: HOPPS
D: ...11, 12, 13, 14. Not including Manchas it's 14... Chief Bogo handed out 14 Missing Mammal files... They're all here. All the missing mammals are right here.
E: lightbulb
N: Before she can respond-- CLICK! A door starts to open, Nick and Hopps retreat, stuck next to a DARK CELL.
C: LIONHEART
D: Enough! I don't want excuses, Doctor, I want answers.
E: O.S.
N: Reveal: Mayor Lionheart berating the BADGER DOCTOR by his side. He looks serious, intense, tired.
C: BADGER DOCTOR
D: Mayor Lionheart, please, we're doing everything we can.
N: Hopps whips out her phone, starts recording.
C: LIONHEART
D: Really? Cuz I got a dozen and a half animals here who've gone off the rails crazy-- and you can't tell me why. Now, I'd call that awfully far from doing everything.
C: BADGER DOCTOR
D: Sir, it may be time to consider their biology.
C: LIONHEART
D: What? What do you mean biology?
C: BADGER DOCTOR
D: The only animals going savage are predators. We cannot keep it a secret. We need to come forward. 77.
C: LIONHEART
D: Hmm... Great idea. Tell the public. And how do you think they're gonna feel about their mayor, who is a lion?! I'll be ruined!
C: BADGER DOCTOR
D: Well, what does Chief Bogo say?
C: LIONHEART
D: Chief Bogo doesn't know. And we are going to keep it that way.
N: Beep-beep-beep-- Hopps' parents call in. She frantically tries to silence her phone.
C: LIONHEART
D: Someone's here!
E: CONT'D
C: BADGER DOCTOR
D: Sir, you need to go, now! Security! Sweep the area!
E: calls out
N: AN ALARM SOUNDS. The door to the cell Hopps and Nick are in triggers shut. They notice WOLVES approaching.
C: NICK
D: Great! We're dead. We're dead. That's it. I'm dead. You're dead. Everybody's dead.
N: This gives Hopps an idea. She looks at the HUGE TOILET.
C: HOPPS
D: Can you swim?
C: NICK
D: What? Can I swim? Yes, I can swim. Why?
N: The Wolves storm in, searching for the intruders... and see the swirling water of a toilet disappearing down the drain. Hopps and Nick fly through the water slide like tubes of the sewer system, cascading over a waterfall. Both scream. They land in the river below. Nick pop up first. He looks desperately for Judy.
C: NICK
D: Carrots?! Hopps?! Judy?!
E: CONT'D
N: She emerges, gasping for breath, holding up the bagged phone.
C: HOPPS
D: We gotta tell Bogo!
S: INT. BOGO'S OFFICE - DAY
N: CLOSE ON BOGO'S PHONE: Gazelle and Bogo dance on stage. It's the same app Clawhauser used earlier.
C: GAZELLE
D: Wow, you are one hot dancer... ...CHIEF BOGO.
E: ON PHONE robo-voice
N: Bogo is dancing along when, suddenly, Clawhauser bursts in.
C: CLAWHAUSER
D: Chief Bogo!
C: BOGO
D: Not now!
E: guilty
C: CLAWHAUSER
D: Wait, is that Gazelle?
C: BOGO
D: No!
E: struggling to silence his phone
C: GAZELLE
D: I am Gazelle, and you are one hot dancer.
E: ON PHONE
C: CLAWHAUSER
D: You have the app too?! Oh, jeeeeez!
E: ecstatic
C: BOGO
D: Clawhauser, can't you see I'm working on the missing mammal cases?!
C: CLAWHAUSER
D: Oh, yes of course! About that, sir... Officer Hopps just called... She found all of `em.
N: Bogo's eyes widen.
C: GAZELLE
D: Wow! I'm impressed. 79.
E: ON PHONE
S: EXT. ASYLUM - DAY
N: Cop cars and helicopters surround the asylum. Hopps, flanked by Bogo and other COPS, leads Lionheart out of the building.
C: HOPPS
D: Mayor Lionheart, you have the right to remain silent. Anything--
C: LIONHEART
D: You don't understand. I was trying to protect the city.
C: HOPPS
D: You were just trying to protect your job.
C: LIONHEART
D: No. Listen, we still don't know why this is happening. It could destroy Zootopia.
C: HOPPS
D: You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law...
N: Nick hangs back, proudly flashing his Junior Detective badge.
S: INT. ZPD - LOBBY
N: Bogo addresses the press. Behind him, POSTERS of the Savage Animals-- each one MUZZLED.
C: BOGO
D: Ladies and Gentlemammals... 14 mammals went missing and all 14 have been found by our newest recruit, who will speak to you in a moment. But first, let me remind you--
N: Bogo's voice trails off in the background as Nick and Hopps watch from the side. Hopps bites her nails, nervous.
C: HOPPS
D: Rrrgh. I am so nervous...
C: NICK
D: Okay, press conference 101: You wanna look smart? 80.
E: MORE
C: NICK
D: Answer their question with your own question and then answer that question. Like this, "Excuse me. Officer Hopps, what can you tell us about the case?" "Well, was this a tough case? Yes. Yes it was." You see?
E: CONT'D pretending to be Hopps
C: HOPPS
D: You should be there with me. We did this together.
C: NICK
D: Well, am I a cop? No. No, I am not.
C: HOPPS
D: Funny you should say that, because I've been thinking... it would be nice to have a partner.
N: She hands Nick an APPLICATION. Then-- click-- she holds out the carrot pen to him.
C: HOPPS
D: Here. In case you need something to write with.
E: CONT'D
C: BOGO
D: At twenty-two hundred hours, we found all these missing animals...
E: O.S.
N: Bellwether gestures to Judy to come up.
C: BELLWETHER
D: Officer Hopps, it's time.
N: As Hopps goes, Nick smiles. He's touched...
C: BOGO
D: So now, I'll turn things over to the officer who cracked the case. Officer Judy Hopps.
N: Hopps takes a deep breath and steps up to the dais.
C: PRESS
D: Officer Hopps! / Over here! / Here!
C: HOPPS
D: Yes? 81.
E: pointing to a REPORTER
C: REPORTER
D: What can you tell us about the animals that went savage?
C: HOPPS
D: Well, the animals in question... Are they all different species? Yes. Yes they are.
E: glances at Nick
N: Nick smiles, gives a thumbs up.
C: REPORTER 2
D: Okay, so what is the connection?
C: HOPPS
D: Well, all we know is that they are all members of the predator family.
C: ANOTHER REPORTER
D: So, predators are the only ones going savage?
C: HOPPS
D: That is accu-- Yes, that is accurate. Yes...
C: REPORTER 3
D: Wow. Why is that happening?
C: HOPPS
D: We still don't know--
N: More disappointed rumbling.
C: HOPPS
D: Ah, it may have something to do with biology.
E: CONT'D trying to appease
N: On Nick-- huh? The press reacts, too... big time.
C: REPORTER
D: What do you mean by that?
E: O.S.
C: HOPPS
D: A biological component. You know, something in their DNA...
C: REPORTER 4
D: In their DNA? Can you elaborate on that, please? 82.
E: more aggressive
C: HOPPS
D: Yes. What I mean is, thousands of years ago... um... predators survived through their aggressive hunting instincts. For whatever reason, they seem to be reverting back to their primitive, savage ways.
N: Nick doesn't like what he's hearing.
C: REPORTER
D: Of course they did.
E: O.S.
N: Nick looks at the posters of the muzzled animals and shakes his head, disbelieving. FLASH BACK to his memory of being muzzled as a child.
C: MEAN KID ANIMAL
D: Aw, is he gonna cry.
E: V.O. during flashback
C: REPORTER
D: Officer Hopps, could it happen again?
E: O.S. on Nick, as flashback ends
C: HOPPS
D: It is possible. So we must be vigilant. And we at the ZPD are prepared and are here to protect you...
N: This sends the Press into an absolute frenzy.
C: PRESS
D: Will more mammals go savage? / What is being done to protect us? / Have you considered a mandatory quarantine on predators?
N: Bellwether steps in, eager to put an end to the questions.
C: BELLWETHER
D: Okay, thank you Officer Hopps, uh, that's all the time that we have. No more questions...
N: Bellwether ushers Hopps off stage.
C: HOPPS Was I okay?
D: 83.
C: BELLWETHER
D: Oh, you did fine.
N: Hopps walks across the lobby to Nick, completely unaware that she just started a controversy.
C: HOPPS
D: That went so fast! I didn't get a chance to mention you or say anything about how we--
E: excited
C: NICK
D: Oh, I think you said plenty.
E: upset
C: HOPPS
D: What do you mean?
C: NICK
D: Clearly, there's a biological component? These predators may be reverting back to their primitive, savage ways. Are you serious?
E: sarcastic, hard
C: HOPPS
D: I just stated the facts of the case. I mean, it's not like a bunny could go savage...
C: NICK
D: Right. But a fox could? Huh?
C: HOPPS
D: Nick, stop it. You're not like them.
C: NICK
D: Oh, there's a them now?
C: HOPPS
D: You know what I mean. You're not that kind of predator.
C: NICK
D: The kind that needs to be muzzled? The kind that makes you think you need to carry around Fox Repellent?
N: Hopps sighs guiltily.
C: NICK
D: Yeah, don't think I didn't notice that little item the first time we met. So let me ask you a question. Are you afraid of me? Do you think I might go nuts? Do you think I might go savage? Do you think I might try to... EAT YOU?!
E: CONT'D escalating anger Hopps looks heartbroken
N: He lunges, like he's going to bite her. She flinches and unthinkingly puts her hand on the repellent.
C: NICK
D: ...I knew it. Just when I thought somebody actually believed in me...
E: CONT'D calm, hurt
N: He shoves the application at her.
C: NICK
D: Probably best if you don't have a predator as a partner.
E: CONT'D
N: As he walks away, he takes off the sticker badge, crumples it and tosses it away.
C: HOPPS
D: No. Nick. Nick!
C: REPORTER 5
D: Officer Hopps! Were you just threatened by that predator?
C: HOPPS
D: No. He's my friend.
C: REPORTER 6
D: We can't even trust our own friends?
C: HOPPS
D: That is not what I said! Please!

D: Our city is 90% prey, Judy. And right now they're just really scared. You're a hero to them. They trust you. And so that's why Chief Bogo and I want you to be the public face of the ZPD.
N: Bogo sits next to Hopps. She looks at the pamphlet again.

N: She removes her badge...
C: BOGO
D: Hopps.
C: BELLWETHER
D: Judy, you've worked so hard to get here. It's what you've wanted since you were a kid. You can't quit...
C: HOPPS
D: Thank you for the opportunity.
N: Hopps sets her badge on the desk and walks out. Bellwether and Bogo look at one another in shock and concern.
T: FADE OUT.
S: EXT. HOPPS' FARMS VEGETABLE STAND - DAY
N: Hopps, with a thousand yard stare, works the carrot stand. She wraps some carrots in a newspaper-- Headline: GROWING UNREST DIVIDES CITY-- and hands them to a RABBIT FAMILY.
C: HOPPS
D: A dozen carrots.
C: RABBIT MOM
D: Thanks!
C: HOPPS
D: Have a nice day.
C: RABBIT MOM
D: Come on.
E: to daughter
N: Hopps reads the paper as Stu and Bonnie approach, concerned.
C: STU HOPPS
D: Hey there, Jude-- Jude the dude, remember that one? How we doin?
C: HOPPS.
D: I'm fine. 89.
C: BONNIE HOPPS
D: You are not fine. Your ears are droopy.
N: Hopps remains fixed on the newspaper and lets out a sigh.
C: HOPPS
D: Why did I think I could make a difference?
C: STU HOPPS
D: Because you're a trier, that's why.
C: BONNIE HOPPS
D: You've always been a trier.
C: HOPPS
D: Oh, I tried. And it made life so much worse for so many innocent predators.
N: Off-screen, BEEP-BEEP.
C: STU HOPPS
D: Oh, not all of them, though. Speak of the devil. Right on time.
N: A truck pulls up. Its sign reads: GIDEON GREY'S GOOD BAKED STUFF... With Fresh Produce From Hopps Family Farms.
C: HOPPS
D: Is that... Gideon Grey?
C: STU HOPPS
D: Yep. It sure is. We work with him now.
C: BONNIE HOPPS
D: He's our partner. And we never would have considered it had you not opened our minds.
C: STU HOPPS
D: That's right. I mean, Gid's turned into one of the top pastry chefs in the tri-burrows.
C: HOPPS
D: That's really cool, you guys.
N: GIDEON GREY, now paunchy, climbs out his truck.
C: HOPPS
D: Gideon Grey. I'll be darned. 90.
E: CONT'D
C: ADULT GIDEON GREY
D: Hey Judy-- I'd like to say I'm sorry for the way I behaved in my youth. I had a lotta self-doubt that manifested itself in the form of unchecked rage and aggression. I was a major jerk.
C: HOPPS
D: Well, I know a thing or two about being a jerk...
C: ADULT GIDEON GREY
D: Anyhow-- I brought you all these pies.
N: He holds out some pies. KID BUNNIES come tearing across the field, bee-lining for the pies. Stu shouts at the kids.
C: STU HOPPS
D: Hey kids! Don't you run through that midnicampum holicithias!
C: RABBIT KID
D: Whoa, whoa, whoa!
E: holding back the others
C: ADULT GIDEON GREY
D: Now there's a 4-dollar word, Mr. H. My family always just called them night howlers.
N: Wait. What?
C: HOPPS
D: I'm sorry, what did you say?
N: Stu gestures to the flowers growing on the edge of the crops.
C: STU HOPPS
D: Oh, Gid's talking about those flowers, Judy. I use `em to keep bugs off the produce. But I don't like the little ones going near `em on account of what happened to your Uncle Terry.
C: BONNIE HOPPS
D: Yeah, Terry ate one whole when we were kids and went completely nuts.
C: STU HOPPS
D: He bit the dickens out of your mother. 91.
C: HOPPS
D: A bunny can go savage...
E: a dawning realization
N: We stay on Hopps as she pieces it together.
C: BONNIE HOPPS
D: Savage? Well, that's a strong word. But it did hurt like the devil.
C: STU HOPPS
D: Well sure it did. There's a sizable divot in your arm. I'd call that savage.
C: HOPPS
D: Night howlers aren't wolves. They're flowers. The flowers are making the predators go savage. That's it! That's what I've been missing!
E: as if doing an equation
N: Hopps races away, then turns back.
C: HOPPS
D: Oh, keys! Keys! Keys! Keys! Hurry! Come on! Thank you, I love you bye!
E: CONT'D
N: Stu tosses her the keys to his pick-up. Hopps jumps into the truck, peels out, leaving Stu and Bonnie in the dust.
C: STU HOPPS
D: You catch any of that, Bon?
C: BONNIE HOPPS
D: Not one bit.
C: GIDEON GREY
D: Well, that makes me feel a little better. I thought she was talking in tongues or something.
S: EXT. ZOOTOPIA - SAHARA SQUARE - STREET
N: Hopps drives the farm truck to Finnick's van. She knocks.
C: FINNICK
D: Who is it?
C: HOPPS
D: I need to find Nick. Please. 92.
N: Finnick gives her a reluctant look, then softens.
S: EXT. BRIDGE - LATER
N: Hopps arrives at an underpass. She looks around, it's a desolate, sad place.
C: HOPPS
D: Nick? Nick!
N: There's Nick, sitting on a lawn chair under the bridge.
C: HOPPS
D: Oh, Nick! Night howlers aren't wolves. They're toxic flowers. I think someone is targeting predators on purpose and making them go savage.
E: CONT'D
C: NICK
D: Wow. Isn't that interesting.
N: He gets up, walks under the bridge. She follows.
C: HOPPS
D: Wait! Wait, please-- I know you'll never forgive me. And I don't blame you. I wouldn't forgive me either. I was ignorant and irresponsible and small-minded... But predators shouldn't suffer because of my mistakes. I have to fix this, but I can't do it without you.
N: He sighs, but still won't look at her.
C: HOPPS
D: And after we're done, you can hate me, and that'll be fine, because I was a horrible friend and I hurt you... and you can walk away knowing you were right all along, I really am just a dumb bunny.
E: CONT'D getting emotional
N: It seems she lost him, then:
C: HOPPS
D: I really am just a dumb bunny. I really am just a dumb bunny.
E: ON RECORDER CONT'D
N: Hopps cocks her head. Huh? Nick turns to her... holding her recording pen.
C: NICK
D: Don't worry, Carrots, I'll let you erase it... in 48 hours.
N: Hopps sniffles and wipes a tear from her eye.
C: NICK
D: Alright, get in here.
E: CONT'D
N: Hopps leans her head on Nick's chest. He gives her a hug.
C: NICK
D: Okay. Oh, you bunnies... You're so emotional. There we go. Deep breath. Are you just trying to steal the pen. Is that what this is? You are standing on my tail, though. Off, off, off.
E: CONT'D then then
C: HOPPS
D: I'm sorry.
S: INT. HOPPS' FAMILY TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER
N: Hopps drives as Nick sits shotgun-- eating blueberries.
C: NICK
D: I thought you guys only grew carrots. What's the plan?
E: then, eats
C: HOPPS
D: We are gonna follow the night howlers.
C: NICK
D: Okay. How?
C: HOPPS
D: Know this guy?
E: shows picture of weasel
C: NICK
D: Uh-huh. I told you, I know everybody. 94.
S: EXT. ZOOTOPIA STREET - LATER
N: We find the weasel selling crappy knock-off merchandise on a street corner.
C: DUKE WEASELTON
D: Well, hello, step right up! Anything you need... I got it. All your favorite movies! I got movies that haven't even been released yet!
N: An ARMADILLO CUSTOMER scans an array of blatant knock-off movies like "Wreck-it Rhino," "Wrangled," and "Pig Hero 6."
C: DUKE WEASELTON
D: Hey, 15% off! 20! Make me an offer! Come on!
E: CONT'D
C: NICK
D: Well, well, look who it is. The duke of bootleg.
E: suddenly appearing
C: DUKE WEASELTON
D: What's it to you, Wilde? Shouldn't you be melting down a popsicle or something? Hey, if it isn't Flopsy the Copsy.
E: sees Hopps
C: HOPPS
D: We both know those weren't moldy onions I caught you stealing. What were you gonna do with those night howlers, Wessleton?
C: DUKE WEASELTON
D: It's Weaselton. Duke Weaselton. And I ain't talking, rabbit. And ain't nothing you can do to make me.
N: Weaselton flicks a toothpick in her face. Hopps smiles at Nick.
S: INT. MR. BIG'S PLACE - A LITTLE LATER
N: We find polar bears holding the weasel over the ice pit.
C: MR. BIG
D: Ice `em. 95.
C: DUKE WEASELTON
D: Aaagh! Agh! Ya dirty rat! Why ya helping her?! She's a cop!
E: to Nick
C: MR. BIG
D: And the godmother to my future granddaughter.
N: Reveal: FRU FRU is pregnant.
C: FRU FRU SHREW
D: I'm gonna name her Judy.
C: HOPPS
D: Aw.
C: MR. BIG
D: Ice this weasel.
E: to polar bears
C: DUKE WEASELTON
D: All right, all right, please! I'll talk! I'll talk. I stole them night howlers so I could sell `em. They offered me what I couldn't refuse... Money.
C: HOPPS
D: And to whom did you sell them?
C: DUKE WEASELTON
D: A ram named Doug. We got a drop spot underground...
E: PRE-LAP
S: EXT. SUBWAY STATION - A LITTLE LATER
N: Nick and Hopps approach an abandoned subway station.
C: DUKE WEASELTON
D: ...Just watch it. Doug is the opposite of friendly. He's unfriendly...
E: V.O.
N: They arrive at the entrance and quickly sneak under the gate.
S: INT. ABANDONED SUBWAY STATION - MOMENTS LATER
N: They emerge on a platform and spot an abandoned subway car.
C: HOPPS
D: Come on!
N: As they sneak up to it... Hopps pulls open the window and looks inside the car. They both jump into...
S: INT. THE GREENHOUSE CAR - CONTINUOUS
N: They both see the rows of night howlers.
C: HOPPS
D: The weasel wasn't lying.
C: NICK
D: Yeah, looks like old Doug's cornered the market on night howlers...
N: Click! A door opens off screen! They quickly hide under a desk as a TOUGH SHEEP LABWORKER enters. He goes through the process of harvesting the pollen, eventually producing a small, blue paint ball pellet of night howler toxin. Nick and Hopps watch it all. The Sheep's phone RINGS.
C: DOUG
D: You got Doug here. What's the mark? Cheetah in Sahara Square. Got it.
E: into phone
N: The Sheep loads a gun, cocks it. We see a MAP with pictures of a various animal targets.
C: DOUG
D: Serious? Yeah, I know they're fast. I can hit him. Listen, I hit a tiny little otter through the open window of a moving car.
E: CONT'D into phone
N: Hearing this, the pieces of the puzzle start falling into place for Hopps. She looks up at the picture of Otterton-- we FLASHBACK to see Doug hitting him with a serum pellet. Then Hopps looks at Manchas's picture-- we FLASHBACK to that.
C: DOUG
D: Yeah I'll buzz you when it's done. Or you'll see it on the news. Ya know, whichever comes first. 97.
E: CONT'D into phone
N: BAM, BAM, BAM! The goons have returned.
C: WOOLTER
D: Hey Doug, open up! We've got your latte.
E: O.S.
C: DOUG
D: Alright, Woolter and Jesse are back, so I'm leaving now. Out.
E: into phone then
N: Hopps looks around, what is she going to do. As Doug goes to the door to unlock it, Hopps creeps out of their hiding spot.
C: NICK
D: Hey. Hey! Where are you going? Get back here! What are you doing?! He's gonna see you! What are you looking at? Hey! Whatever you're thinking, stop thinking it. Carrots! Carrots!
C: DOUG
D: It better have the extra foam this time--
N: BAM! Hopps kicks Woolter in the back, knocking him into the other two Thugs. Hopps locks the door.
C: WOOLTER
D: Hey, open up!
E: O.S.
N: The Thugs start banging on the doors.
C: NICK
D: What are you doing?! You just trapped us in here!
C: HOPPS
D: We need to get this evidence to the ZPD.
N: Nick picks up the case.
C: NICK
D: Okay. Great. Here it is. Got it.
C: HOPPS
D: No. All of it!
C: NICK
D: Wait, what? 98.
N: Hopps rushes to the control room, tries to start the engine.
C: NICK
D: Great, you're a conductor now? Hey, listen-- It would take a miracle to get this rust-bucket going.
E: CONT'D
N: The train starts moving.
C: NICK
D: Well... Hallelujah!
E: CONT'D
S: INT. TRAIN TRACKS - SAME
C: DOUG
D: We kinda got a situation at the lab... Oh! It just got worse!
E: on the phone noticing train
N: Doug and his minions race after the train. BACK TO:
S: INT. SUBWAY CAR - SAME
N: Nick and Hopps race away, feeling fairly confident.
C: NICK
D: Mission accomplished. Would it be premature for me to do a little victory toot-toot?
C: HOPPS
D: All right. One toot-toot.
N: Nick blows the train whistle.
C: NICK
D: Well, I can cross that off the bucket list.
N: Things are looking up, when: BAM! Woolter just busted into the car. Nick slams the door closed right before Woolter gets to them.
C: NICK
D: I may have to rescind that victory toot-toot. 99.
E: CONT'D
N: Noise from the roof above them... BAM! BAM! BAM!
C: NICK
D: Maybe that's just hail?
E: CONT'D
N: Uh-oh. Jesse busts through the window. He's stuck, but flailing at Hopps. Nick tries to pull him away.
C: NICK
D: Back off!
E: CONT'D
N: Nick gets punched backward and notices Woolter charging toward the door at full speed. Right before Woolter arrives, Nick pulls the door open.
C: NICK
D: Incoming!
E: CONT'D
N: Woolter's momentum carries him into Jesse-- dislodging him onto the tracks. Hopps is knocked out the window, but grabs onto Woolter's horn. Hopps tries to hang on as the subway car hurtles down the tunnel.
C: NICK
D: Carrots?!
E: CONT'D
C: HOPPS
D: Don't stop! Keep going!
E: to Nick
C: JESSE
D: No! No! Please stop!
E: about to get run over
C: HOPPS
D: Do not stop this car!
N: Jesse dives to safety and Hopps gets bucked up onto the top of the train. Nick takes the wheel as the train emerges above ground. Hopps looks up to see... Another train coming toward them... on the same track! She sees a turn-off switch ahead.
C: HOPPS
D: Speed up, Nick! Speed up!
E: CONT'D
C: NICK
D: There's another train coming!
E: staving off Woolter
C: HOPPS
D: Trust me! SPEED! UP!
N: Woolter sees the train coming and tries to get unstuck, but he can't. He struggles like crazy.
C: WOOLTER
D: Stop the train! Hey!
N: Then, at the last second, Hopps appears next to him:
C: HOPPS
D: Hey. Need some help?
N: Hopps kicks Woolter off the train and he lands perfectly on the turn-off switch on the tracks below. At the last possible second, their train switches tracks-- just avoiding the oncoming car. Except...
C: NICK
D: Oh no! Oh no, no, no! Too fast! Hold on!
N: The train derails as it takes the curve. The night howlers catch fire.
C: NICK
D: I think this is our stop!
E: CONT'D
N: Hopps and Nick dive out of the car and onto a subway platform... Just as the lab car EXPLODES.
C: HOPPS
D: Okay... Maybe some of the evidence survived.
N: A second loud EXPLOSION. The train is destroyed.
C: HOPPS
D: Everything is gone. We've lost it all.
E: CONT'D
C: NICK
D: Yeah. Oh, except for this.
E: shaking head
N: Nick holds up a case-- containing a gun and a pellet.
C: HOPPS
D: Oh, Nick! Yes!
N: Judy SMACKS him on the arm. Hard. Nick grimaces.
C: NICK
D: Ow. 101.
C: HOPPS
D: Come on! We gotta get to the ZPD. Cut through the Natural History Museum!
S: INT. NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM - NIGHT
N: Nick and Hopps race through the empty museum. The ZPD entrance is just ahead.
C: HOPPS
D: Oh! There it is!
N: They're going to make it.
C: BELLWETHER
D: Judy! Judy!
E: O.S.
N: Judy and Nick stop and turn. There's Bellwether, standing behind them with TWO RAM COPS.
C: HOPPS
D: Mayor Bellwether! We found out what's happening. Someone's darting predators with a serum-- that's what's making them go savage.
E: out of breath, rapidly
C: BELLWETHER
D: I am so proud of you, Judy. You did just a super job.
E: applauding
C: HOPPS
D: Thank you, ma'am. How did you know where to find us?
E: troubling realization
C: BELLWETHER
D: I'll go ahead and I'll take that case now.
C: HOPPS
D: You know what... I think Nick and I will just take this to the ZPD...
N: Hopps turns toward the ZPD. Uh oh. One of Bellwether's RAMS is blocking the way. Nick just now gets what's going on.
C: HOPPS NICK
D: Run! Run! 102.
E: CONT'D
N: They take off-- away from the ZPD-- down a dark corridor.
C: BELLWETHER
D: Get them!
N: Hopps looks over her shoulder as she runs-- not seeing a sharp WOOLY MAMMOTH TUSK sticking out. It slashes her leg, knocking her off her feet.
C: HOPPS
D: Ach!
C: NICK
D: Ah Carrots!
N: Nick goes to her. Her leg is bleeding badly.
C: NICK
D: I got ya, come here, come here.
E: CONT'D
N: He carries her behind a pillar.
C: NICK
D: Okay, now just relax.
E: CONT'D
N: Nick digs a handkerchief from his pocket. A few BLUEBERRIES fall out with it.
C: NICK
D: Whoops... Blueberry?
E: CONT'D
C: HOPPS
D: Pass.
C: BELLWETHER
D: Come on out, Judy!
E: O.S.
C: HOPPS
D: Take the case. Get it to Bogo.
C: NICK
D: I'm not gonna leave you behind. That's not happening.
C: HOPPS
D: I can't walk.
C: NICK
D: Just, we'll think of something.
N: Bellwether finally appears, flanked by the Rams.
C: BELLWETHER
D: We're on the same team, Judy! 103.
N: WITH BELLWETHER & THUGS -- Bellwether talks as they look for Hopps and Nick...
C: BELLWETHER
D: Underestimated. Under-appreciated. Aren't you sick of it? Predators. They may be strong and loud, but prey out-number predators 10 to one.
N: Bellwether sees a SHADOW-- RABBIT EARS. She gestures to the RAMS-- there they are.
C: BELLWETHER
D: Think of it-- 90 percent of the population, united against a common enemy. We'll be unstoppable.
E: CONT'D
N: The Rams are about to pounce on Hopps and Nick... only to find the shadow is coming from a MUMMIFIED JACKALOPE being illuminated by a shop light.
C: BELLWETHER
D: Over there!
E: CONT'D to Goons
N: Hopps and Nick are making a run for it. They're going to make it to the ZPD! When suddenly... BAM! A RAM tackles them both, knocking the case out of Nick's paws. Both of them fall into a sunken diorama. Bellwether, with case in hand, looks over the edge.
C: BELLWETHER
D: Well, you should have stayed on the carrot farm, huh? It really is too bad; I really did like you.
E: CONT'D
C: HOPPS
D: What are you going to do? Kill me?
C: BELLWETHER
D: No! Of course not... he is.
N: Bellwether takes the dart gun out of the case, aims at Nick and... THWICK! She darts him.
C: HOPPS
D: No! Nick?!
N: Nick starts to shake and crouch. Bellwether dials her phone.
C: BELLWETHER
D: Yes, police! There's a savage fox in the natural history museum. Officer Hopps is down! Please hurry!
N: Nick is starting to turn.
C: HOPPS
D: No. Nick, don't do this. Fight it.
C: BELLWETHER
D: Oh, but he can't help it, can he? Since preds are just biologically predisposed to be savages.
N: Nick stalks Hopps, who tries to limp away.
C: BELLWETHER
D: Gosh, think of the headline: "Hero Cop Killed By Savage Fox..."
E: CONT'D
C: HOPPS
D: So that's it, prey fears predator, and you stay in power?
C: BELLWETHER
D: Yeah, pretty much.
C: HOPPS
D: It won't work.
C: BELLWETHER
D: Fear always works. And I'll dart every predator in Zootopia to keep it that way.
C: HOPPS
D: Oh, Nick! No!
E: as Nick stalks her
C: BELLWETHER
D: Bye-Bye, Bunny.
N: Nick lunges. He attacks. Hopps screams. Bellwether smiles.
C: HOPPS
D: Blood, blood, blood! And death.
N: Bellwether looks confused. Nick stands up.
C: NICK
D: All right, you're milking it. Besides, I think we got it, I think we got it. We got it up there, thank you yakkety-yak-- you laid it all out beautifully.
C: BELLWETHER
D: What?
N: Bellwether looks at her gun, in disbelief.
C: NICK
D: Yea, oh, are you looking for the serum? Well, it's right here.
E: holds it up
C: HOPPS
D: What you've got in the weapon there- - those are blueberries. From my family's farm.
N: Livid, Bellwether sees a blueberry in the gun's chamber.
C: NICK
D: They are delicious. You should try some.
E: licking fingers
C: BELLWETHER
D: I framed Lionheart, I can frame you too! It's my word against yours!
C: HOPPS
D: Oooo, actually--
N: Hopps holds up the carrot pen. BELLWETHER (ON CARROT PEN RECORDER) And I'll dart every predator in Zootopia to keep it that way...
C: HOPPS
D: --It's your word against yours. It's called a hustle, sweetheart. Boom.
N: Bogo and a TEAM OF COPS burst onto the scene. Bellwether looks to run but there's nowhere to go. She's nailed.
T: CUT TO:

N: A FELINE REPORTER, KITTY COWLICK, interviews Lionheart.
C: LIONHEART

N: BACK TO THE NEWS DESK --

E: CONT'D to Hopps
S: EXT. ZOOTOPIA CENTRAL PLAZA - DAY
N: Hopps walks through the CENTRAL PLAZA of ZOOTOPIA. She looks around to see animals coming back together. She focuses on two KIDS: one pred, one prey playing soccer.
C: HOPPS
D: When I was a kid, I thought Zootopia was this perfect place where everyone got along and anyone could be anything...
E: V.O.
N: Hopps kicks the soccer ball with the kids.
C: HOPPS
D: Turns out, real life's a little bit more complicated than a slogan on a bumper sticker. Real life is messy.
E: V.O.
N: AT THE ZPD: Hopps enters to find Clawhauser back at his desk, unpacking. What's more-- TWO COPS approach him with donuts.
C: HOPPS
D: We all have limitations. We all make mistakes. Which means-- hey, glass half full!-- we all have a lot in common. And the more we try to understand one another, the more exceptional each of us will be. But we have to try.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. CADET TRAINING GROUNDS - DAY
N: Reveal: Hopps is giving a commencement address to the GRADUATES of the Police Academy.

C: HOPPS
D: I implore you... try. Try to make the world a better place.
E: CONT'D
N: On stage, Hopps readies to pin a BADGE on Nick. As she approaches, they exchange a nod-- a small, sincere gesture. She places the badge, then gives Nick an official salute.
C: HOPPS
D: Look inside yourself, and recognize that change starts with you. It starts with me. It starts with all of us.
E: CONT'D
N: Caps are thrown in the air. The music fades out, leaving just the APPLAUSE, which is interrupted by:

S: INT. / EXT. COP CAR (DRIVING SHOTS) - DAY
N: Hopps drives. Nick rides shotgun, eating a Pawpsickle.
C: NICK
D: So are all rabbits bad drivers or is it just you?
N: She slams on the brakes. He lurches forward, accidentally jamming the Pawpsickle into his face.

D: Oops. Sorry.

D: Sly bunny.
E: as he wipes off his face
C: HOPPS
D: Dumb fox.
C: NICK
D: You know you love me.
C: HOPPS
D: Do I know that? Yes. Yes, I do.
N: They smile wide. They're stopped at a red light, when suddenly-- a TRICKED OUT RED SPORTS CAR blasts through the light! They look at each other and smile even wider. Hopps stomps on the gas. Nick hits the siren. The patrol car takes off...
S: EXT. STREETS OF ZOOTOPIA - MOMENTS LATER
N: The fleeing sports car comes to a screeching halt. ANGLE ON the license plate: FST NML. Hopps and Nick exit their car and approach the driver.
C: HOPPS
