S: INT. CLUTTERED WORKSHOP -- DAY
N: Moving along a row of CANARIES in CAGES.
T: CUTTER (V.O.)
N: Every magic trick consists of three part, or acts... Stop at a cage. Weathered HANDS envelope the canary. Hands and voice belongs to a man in his 60's- CUTTER.
T: CUTTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
N: The first part is called the Pledge... A LITTLE GIRL pershes on a chest in the workshop, watching.
T: CUTTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
N: ...the magician shows you something
C: ORDINARY-
D: Cutter moves to a small ORNATE CAGE resting on a prop table.
T: CUTTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
N: A deck of cards, ar a bird...
S: INT. SCALA THEATRE, LONDON -- NIGHT
N: A packed house. Many hands raised. Move in on a BEARDED MAN, his gloved hand tentatively rising into the air.
T: CUTTER (V.O.)
N: ...or a man. A GLAMOROUS ASSISTANT beckons Bearded Man from the aisle. He shuffles along his row towards her. Embarrassed.
T: CUTTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
N: He show you this object, and pledges to you its utter normality... Bearbed Man and four other VOLUNTEERS follow the Assistant down towards the stage... On which stands the magician, leaning on his cane, smiling. This is ROBERT ANGIER, 35, an American. Looming over him is a large and complex ELETRICAL MACHINE.
T: CUTTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
N: Perhaps he asks you to inspect it... Bearbed Man, FASCINATED, and other Volunteers look over the vast machine. As angier GESTURES theatrically at the various features of the metal and glass apparatus.
T: CUTTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
N: ...to see that it is indeed real... As the Assistant leads the Volunteers off the stage, Bearded Man slips through the gap at the side of the curtains-
T: CUTTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
N: ...unaltered...
S: INT. STAGE THEATRE, BACKSTAGE -- CONTINUOUS
N: -looks around, DISORIENTED, then darts for some stairs leagind below stage where he runs into a burly STAGEHAND.
T: CUTTER (V.O.)
N: ...normal.
C: STAGEHAND
D: Where'd you think you're going?!
T: CUTTER (V.O.)
N: But, of course, it probably isn't... Bearded Man pulls off his beard, revealing the face of ALFRED BORDEN, mid 30's.
C: BEARDED MAN
D: I'm part of the act, you fool!
N: The Stagehand raises his eyebrows and steps aside. Borden RACES down below the stage. Cutter approaches the Stagehand.
T: CUTTER
N: Who was that?
S: INT. SCALA THEATRE, ONSTAGE -- CONTINUOUS
N: As the machine GROANS to life. SPARKING and CRACKLING, Angier gazes at it, forgettig his audience. Entranced. Possessed.
S: INT. BENEATH THE STAGE -- CONTINUOUS
N: Borden fumbles through the darkned area, lit by flashes and sparks through gaps in the boards of the stage above. He GASPS as a flash illuminates a STAGEHAND with SOLID WHITE EYES sitting nearby. Borden waves a hand in front of the
S: INT. WORKSHOP -- DAY
N: Cutter gently places the canary into the ornate cage.
T: CUTTER (V.O.)
N: The second act is called the Turn...
S: INT. SCALA THEATRE, ONSTAGE -- NIGHT
N: Angier, facing the audience, steps into the machine.
T: CUTTER (V.O.)
N: The magician takes the ordinary something...
S: INT. BENEATH THE STAGE -- CONTINUOUS
N: Borden lights a MATCH. In front of him is a LARGE GLASS TANK FILLED WITH WATER, ITs LID PROPPED OPEN. Borden frowns.
T: CUTTER (V.O.)
N: ...and makes it do something extraordianry.
S: INT. WORKSHOP -- DAY
N: Cutter places a SILK SHAWL over the cage. Then SLAMS his hands down on the shawl, which FLATTENS- The Little Girl FLINCHES. Then STARES, FASCINATED.
T: CUTTER (V.O.)
N: Now you're looking for the secret.
S: INT. SCALA THEATRE, ONSTAGE -- NIGHT
N: Bolts of electicity draw inwards, wrapping Angier in a ball of light which CRACKS-
T: CUTTER (V.O.)
N: But you won't find it...
S: INT. BENEATH THE STAGE -- CONTINUOUS
N: The ROOM fills with light as a TRAPDOOR snaps open and a BODY DROPS INTO THE TANK.
T: CUTTER
N: Because of course, you're not really looking... The lid of the tank and trapdoor above SNAP SHUT, leaving the tank, and Borden, in complete DARKNESS.
T: CUTTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
N: ...you don't really want to know.
S: INT. WORKSHOP -- DAY
N: Cutter WHIPS the shawl from the table. Cage and bird have DISAPPEARED.
T: CUTTER (V.O.)
N: ...you want to be fooled. The Little Girl stares, EXPECTANT.
T: CUTTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
N: But you couldn't clap yet. Because making something disappear isn't enough... you have to bring it back.
S: INT. SCALA THEATRE, ONSTAGE -- CONTINUOUS
N: The MACHINE sputters to a stop. Angier is GONE. The audience sits, WAITING.
T: CUTTER (V.O.)
N: That's why every magic trick has a third act. The hardest part..,
S: INT. WORKSHOP -- DAY
N: Cutter forms a fist. Drapes the shawl over it.
T: CUTTER (V.O.)
N: ...the part we call... Cutter WHIPS the shawl away to reveal- the CANARY. The Little Girl CLAPS.
S: INT. BENEATH THE STAGE -- NIGHT
N: Borden LIGHTS another match. Stares in HORROR-
T: CUTTER (V.O.)
N: ...The Prestige. Inside the tank, ANGIER IS DROWNING. His rolling EYES fixes on BORDEN, he POUNDS desperately on the thick glass, SCREAMING BUBBLES... The screen fades to BLACK.
T: PROSECUTOR (V.O.)
N: The Prestige...?
S: INT. COURTROOM -- DAY
N: The PROSECUTOR turns to face the witness in the box: Cutter.
T: PROSECUTOR
N: And did Robert Angier, the Great Danton, your employer, get to that final part of his trick that night?
T: CUTTER
N: No, sir. Something went wrong.
T: PROSECUTOR
N: What went wrong?
T: CUTTER
N: I saw a someone head below the stage... I followed... and I found BORDEN- Cutter points at the dock: Borden is there, CHAINED TO THE FLOOR. FLANKED BY GUARDS. Cutter POINTS.
T: CUTTER (CONT'D)
N: -watching Mr. Angier drown in a tank.
T: PROSECUTOR
N: Would you describe your occupation
T: to the jury please, Mr.Cutter? CUTTER
N: I'm an ingeneur. I design illusions and construct the apparatus necessary for perfoming them.
T: PROSECUTOR
N: And for how long had you been Mr.Angier's "ingeneur"?
T: CUTTER
N: Eight years. I was privvy to the secrets of his entire act.
T: PROSECUTOR So, Mr.Cutter, was this water-filled
N: tank beneath the stage part of Mr.Angier's illusion- the illusion billed as "THE REAL TRANSPORTED MAN"?
T: CUTTER
N: No, sir. The tank had been used for the first trick, then taken offstage. Borden must have put it under the trap door after the interval. Cutter looks across at Borden, who is absently tapping his hand against the rail- it is MUTILATED, MISSING 2 1/2 FINGERS. The DEFENDER STANDS.
C: DEFENDER
D: How large was this tank?
T: CUTTER
N: The sort of tank used for underwater escapes- four or five hundred gallons.
C: DEFENDER
D: How do you think Mr.Borden was able to move the tank under the trap door without anyone noticing?
T: CUTTER
N: Ask him- he's the magician. Titters from the gallery. The Defenser turns to the JUDGE. DEFENDER (IMPATIENT) I ask again that this man explain the mechanics of Mr.Angier's illusion.
T: CUTTER
N: (ANGRY) If I reveal my magician's secrets here in open court, I'll be unemployable and the secrets will be worthless. The Real Transported Man is the most sought-after illusion in the business and I have te right to sell it on. The Judge considers this. He looks at Cutter. Sympathetic.
C: JUDGE
D: Mr.Cutter, I see your predicament but we are talking about a capital offence- Alfred Borden's life hangs in the balance.
T: Cutter looks down. Quiet.
C: JUDGE
D: If you were prepared to disclose the details to me in private, I might be able to judge their relevance to the case.
E: CONT'D
N: (ADDRESSES LAWYERS) Might this be an acceptable compromisse? Amid murmurs of assent, the Judge ADJOURNS the proceedings. As the Guards begin the complex ritual of unlocking Borden's chainsa from the floor, Borden's looks across the courtroom: The LITTLE GIRL from the opening stands in the gallery, looking back at him. Borden gives her a little WAVE. She waves back, then is GUIDED OUT by a man wearing GLOVES and BOWLER HAT- this is FALLON. He nods at Borden.
S: EXT. PRISON YARD, NEWGATE PRISON -- DAY
N: OWENS, 50's a lawyer, stands at the entry gate. The CAPTAIN of the guard walks out to greet him.
C: CAPTAIN
D: I'm going to have to ask you to turn out your pockets.
N: Owens raises his eyebrows.
C: CAPTAIN
D: Not my idea, sir. The Warden saw his show in Manchester last year where he vanished into thin air- he's convinced he'll try an escape.
E: CONT'D
N: Owens smiles as he hands over his pocket watch ans wallet. They walk along a hall wrought iron fence. The PRISON looms over them. A door in the prison opens and Borden emerges, trussed absurdly in chains held by two WARDERS. The other INMATES begin cattle-calling and whistling as BOrden is paraded up to a WOODEN SECTION of the fence.
C: CAPTAIN
D: I told him the only way Borden's going to disappear is if I leave him out with the others immates.
E: CONT'D
N: At the fence, the Warders lock the ends of their chains to a thick eye hook set into the ground. CAPTAIN (CONT'D) (TO WARDERS) Check the locks. Twice. They check the locks. Then retreat to allow privacy. The Captain marches away. Borden looks at Owens. Bored.
C: OWENS
D: My name is Owens- I'm a solicitor.
N: Borden says nothing.
C: OWENS
D: I represent Lord Caldlow, and accomplished amateur magician and historian of magic-
E: CONT'D
C: BORDEN
D: How much?
C: OWENS
D: Lord Caldlow is interested in-
N: BORDEN (COLD) How much for my tricks?
C: OWENS
D: Five thousand pounds.
C: BORDEN
D: Talk to Fallon, my ingenuer- the money's for him.
C: OWENS
D: I did. He offered to sell all of your tricks... except the most valuable one - The Transported Man.
C: BORDEN
D: I'd never forgive myself for selling my greatest trick. Borden signals the Wardens to come and unlock him.
C: OWENS
D: Even for your daughter? Borden looks up. Owens moves closer, quietly assertive.
C: OWENS
D: If the newspapers are right, and you're for the drop, your daughter's going to need looking after
E: CONT'D
C: BORDEN
D: Fallon can take care of-
C: OWENS
D: Bernard Fallon? A man with a past even more obscure than your own? The court have already motioned to have the girl removed from his "care". No, the girl is to be an orphan. I've been to the work house... Owens looks around the prison yard. Shrugs.
C: OWENS
D: It's better than this. Borden looks at Owens, hard. The Warders unlock Borden.
E: CONT'D
C: OWENS
D: I'm offering you a way to warp up your affairs with dignity, and I'm offering your daughter a future. As Lord Caldlow's ward she will want for nothing. Ever. Think it over.
E: CONT'D hands him a card
N: Borden absently VANISHES the card as a REFLEX.
C: OWENS
D: Lord Caldlow wanted you to have this- (produces a leather
E: CONT'D
C: BOUND JOURNAL)
D: As a show of good faith. He thought it might be of interest.
N: A SULLEN WALDER TALKS the journal, flicks through it.
C: OWENS
D: Robert Angier's diary... It includes the time he spent in Colorado learning your trick...
E: CONT'D
N: Sullen hands the journal to Borden. Borden takes it.
C: BORDEN
D: Angier never learned my trick.
C: OWENS
D: Really? When he returned from Colorado he mounted a version of the Transported Man that the papers said was better, even...
N: (WITH RELISH) Than your original. BORDEN (ACID) If you want Angier's secret you can dig him up and ask him for yourself. Borden TURNS, dragging the Warders with him.
C: OWENS
D: I want your secret, Mr.Borden...
N: (LOUDER) Consider your daughter!
S: INT. CELL, NEWGATE PRISON -- DAY
N: Borden, on the bed, opens Angier's JOURNAL. Starts to read...
C: ANGIER
D: A cypher. An enigma...
E: V.O.
T: CUT TO:
N: LETTERS ON A PAGE. IN MEANINGLESS COMBINATIONS. GIBBERISH.
S: INT. TRAIN, MOUNTAINS -- DUSK
N: Aniger, with a SIGH, closes a CARDBOARD-COVERED NOTEBOOK. OPENS his LEATHER-BOUND JOURNAL. Starts to write.
C: ANGIER
D: ...Borden's cypher is simple- unraveled by a single word. Now it takes only patience. And a passion to know his mind.
E: V.O.
N: Angier lloks up at his own reflection in the train window.
S: EXT. TRAIN STATION -- DUSK
N: No platform, no office, no sign. Just an electric streetlight which, as Angier watches, FLICKERS ON. Angier, leaning heavily on his cane limps over to the light and stares up at it as he's never seen one before.
C: VOICE
D: Mr.Angier? Welcome to Colorado Springs.
E: O.S.
N: Angier looks back and smiles. A driver is looking down expectantly from atop a STAGECOACH. Angier hands his cane up to the driver nd , with some difficulty, hitches his way up to the roof of the rig. As he does, the town of Colorado Springs rises into view, a few hundred yards down the road, lit brightly with ELECTRIC STREETLIGHTS. ANGIER (DISBELIEF) The whole town has electricity? The driver nods and WHIPS the horses into action.
S: EXT. ROAD, PIKE'S PEAK -- EVENING
N: The Stagecoach flies along, inches from a precipitious drop. It rounds a corner and pulls to a halt in front of the CLIFF HOUSE INN, equal parts log cabin and crystal palace.
S: INT. CLIFF HOUSE INN -- CONTINUOUS
N: The lobby is cavernous and immaculate. The entire STAFF of the hotel - BELLBOYS, MAIDS, COOKS, and GARDENERS - are lined up along the sides like a regiment of soldiers. Angier reaches the reception desk and the smiling MANAGER.
C: ANGIER
D: Quit a reception.
C: MANAGER
D: You're our first guest of the season, Mr.Angier. Your telegram didn't indicate how long you would be staying with us.
E: opens guest book
C: ANGIER
D: As long as it takes.
N: (SIGNS BOOK) I'll need a coach tomorrow to take me up the mountain.
C: MANAGER
D: The peak is closed, sit. For scientific experimentation.
N: ANGIER (SMILES) That's why I'm here.
S: EXT. ROAD, PIKE'S PEAK -- MORNING
N: A stagecoach rumbles along a dirt track, The driver pulls on his reigns and the coach pulls to a stop.
C: DRIVER
D: You have to walk the reat, I'm afraid, sir.
N: Angier nods. Lowers himself down to the roadway.
S: EXT. CLEARING, PIKE'S PEAK -- MORNING
N: Angier comes through the trees to find a wire fence with a sign: EXTREME DANGER- NO TRESPASSING Beyond the fence is a COMPOUND of three BARNS. Rising from the center barn is a 200ft steel TOWER capped with a GIANT STEEL BALL. GIANT ARCING BOLTS of electricity run down the tower from the ball. The windows of the building RADIATH with BLUE EXPLOSIONS. Angier stops forwards, entranced, and threads his fingers through the fence. He is sent FLYING backwards -- the fence has been electrified. The tower is SHUT OFF- a door opens and a stout little MAN, shotgun under one arm, MARCHES up to the fence. He uses a RUBBER PAD to pry open the fence and stands over Angier, who is CURLED on the ground, GROWNLING in pain, trying to stand.
C: SHOTGUN
D: I'm amazed at how many of you newspaper writers can't read mu sign.
N: Shotgun picks up Angier's cane and hands it to him.
C: ANGIER
D: Not the welcome I was expecting.
N: Shotgun RECOGNIZES Angier, AMAZED.
C: SHOTGUN
D: I know you. You're that magician-the Great Danton. I'm Alley. I saw your show. IN London. Seven times- you guessed every object the audience had in their pockets. Angier leans on his cane and gently brushes off the dirt.
E: helps Angier up
C: ALLEY
D: I'm sorry about the fence. People keep interfering with our work.
C: ANGIER
D: I've come to see Tesla.
C: ALLEY
D: Why?
C: ANGIER
D: He built a machine for a- for a colleague of mine. A long time ago. Can you get me a meeting with him? I've come a very long way.
E: off his look
C: ALLEY
D: Impossible, I'm afraid.
C: ANGIER
D: I've brought a lot of money. Beat.
C: ALLEY
D: I'm sorry, Mr.Angier. I simply can't help you. Alley pulls the fence closed.
C: ANGIER
D: I'll be staying at the hotel. Indefinitely. Alley watches Angier walk away. He pulls something from his pocket.
C: ALLEY What am I holding?
D: Angier doesn't look back.
C: ANGIER
D: Your watch.
N: Alley GRINS, opening his hand. He is holding a gold watch.
S: INT. HOTEL ROOM, COLORADO -- DAY
N: Angier sits, the cardboard-bound notebook on the table in front of him. He makes a notations in his own journal as he deciphers Borden's words.
C: ANGIER
D: April 3rd, 1893... a few days after he first met me...
E: V.O.
N: Angier runs his finger along the first line, translating...
C: BORDEN
D: We were too young men at the start of a great career...
E: V.O.
S: INT. THEATRE -- NIGHT
N: Borden sits in the audience. Younger- both hands intact.
C: BORDEN
D: Two young man devoted to an illusion...
E: V.O.
N: Two rows in front sits Angier. Similarly youthful.
C: BORDEN
D: Two young men who never intended to hurt anyone.
E: V.O. CONT'D
N: Onstage is a TANK. Standing beside the tank is a beautiful young magician's assistant. JULIA. The magician, MILTOn, adress the audience.
C: MILTON
D: Which of you brave souls is willing to bind this lovely young woman...
N: Milton GESTURES to Julia- the MEN in the crowd go wild- hands in the air, catcalls. Smiling radiantly, Julia selects two young men, who SCRAMBLE up to the stage- ANGIER and BORDEN: younger, full of energy- Angier has no limp. They spring onto stage, beside Julia and take the ROPE she offers them. Milton GRABS a HOOK that descends from the flies on a chain. Cutter is watching fron the wings.
C: MILTON
D: Are either of you two gentlemen gailors?
E: CONT'D
N: Both shakes their hands as they start to bind Julia with the ropes, Borden wrapping the rope around her wrists, Angier the one around her ankles.
C: MILTON
D: Well, I'm sure you can both tie a strong knot...
E: CONT'D
N: As Borden finishes his knot tests it, it SLIPS APART. Borden frowns, hastly RETYING it, covering.
T: Cutter NOTICES.
N: Borden finishes, glancing at julia who gives a small sign of assent with her eyes. As Angier finishes tying her ankles he sneaks a light KISS on her ankle. She frowns at him and raises her arms. Milton hooks the rope onto the chain. Milton gesticulates in the wings, Cutter signals to a stagehand who starts HOISTING Julia into the air. Milton wheels the tank under Julia's bare feet. Cutter feels for the handle of an AXE placed by his feet and pulls out a
C: STOPWATCH.
D: JULIA looks down at Angier. They smile at each other. Julia DROPS into the tank with a massive splash- Milton SLAMS the lid shut, PADLOCKS it and raises a curtain around the tank...
N: Cutter checks his stopwatch, grips the handle of the axe... A grand GESTURE from Milton- the curtain around the tank DROPS- Julia is GONE. Milton raises the curtain again, then with another flourish, DROPS it to reveal JULIA, beside the tank, one arm in the air, dripping wet, smiling. The audience erupts in APPLAUSE. Angier smiles produly.
S: INT. DRESSING ROOM -- NIGHT
N: Angier, Borden and Julia sit around the cluttered room. Borden is in the middle of a passionate rant-
C: BORDEN
D: Milton's squadering their goodwill or a bunch of tired second-hand tricks-
N: ANGIER (AMUSED) Old favourites, please.
C: BORDEN
D: What about something fresh? He won't even try a bullet catch-
T: CUTTER (O.S.)
N: Bullet catch is suicide. They turn. Cutter stands in the doorway, counting out money.
T: CUTTER (O.S.) (CONT'D)
N: All it takes is a smart-arse volunteer dropping a button down the barrel... BORDEN (INDICATES HIMSELF AND ANGIER) USE PLANTS-
C: ANGIER
D: He can't use plants for every trick.
C: JULIA
D: There'd be no seats left for the punters.
C: BORDEN
D: Fine- no bullet catch. But a real magician tries to invent something new, something other magicians scratch their heads over-
T: CUTTER
N: They sells it to them for a small fortune.
T: Cutter hands Angier some money. CUTTER (CONT'D)
N: I suposse you have such a trick, Mr.Borden?
C: ANGIER
D: Actually, I do.
T: CUTTER
N: Care to sell it?
C: BORDEN
D: No one else could do my trick.
C: ANGIER
D: I could.
C: BORDEN
D: You don't even know what it is.
C: ANGIER
D: Show it to me twice, I'll do it.
T: Cutter looks at Borden, thoughtful. CUTTER
N: I admire your spirit, Mr.Angier. But if Borden here really has invented his masterpiece it might well be something only he can do.
C: ANGIER
D: Why?
T: CUTTER
N: It might be something only he is prepared to do. (gestures to the props) my illusions employer, Mr.Milton, is a skilled showman. But Borden's right- he won't get his hands dirty. You want to see what it takes to make real magic- go to the Tenley. There's a Chinaman there who's got what it takes.
C: ANGIER
D: Chung Ling Soo.
C: BORDEN
D: Tickets are pricey.
T: CUTTER
N: I know a lad on the door. You two watch his show- whoever tells me how he does his goldfish bowl trick gets the prize.
C: ANGIER
D: Which is?
T: Cutter gives a sly smile. CUTTER
N: Ten minutes onstage in front of my old friend, Mr.Ackerman. Angier and Borden prick up at the name.
C: JULIA
D: Who's Ackerman?
C: BORDEN
D: The most powerful theatrical agent in London.
N: Cutter holds out money to Borden, who reaches for it- Cutter grabs his wrist. Serious.
T: CUTTER
N: I saw you drop the knot again, Borden.
C: JULIA
D: I think I had my wrist turned-
T: CUTTER
N: (IGNORING JULIA) Some nights you just can't get it, can you? If that knot slips when Julia's on the hoist she'll break a leg. BORDEN (DEFENSIVE) It's the wrong knot. A Langford double would hold tighter.
T: CUTTER
N: The Langford double's not a wet knot it's too dangerous. The ropes could swell and she'd never slip it-
C: JULIA
D: I can slip a Lanford underwater.
C: BORDEN
D: We've been practiced it-
N: ANGIER
T: (CUTTING IN)
N: He said no. Julia glances at Angier.
T: CUTTER
N: (TO BORDEN) No more mistakes. Borden stares at Cutter. Leaves. Angier watches him go.
C: ANGIER
D: Where's he from?
T: CUTTER
N: Where are you from? Angier nods. Fair enough.
T: CUTTER (CONT'D)
N: He shuffles props for Virgil at the Hall.
C: ANGIER
D: He works for another magician? Aren't you worried he'll steal your tricks?
T: CUTTER
N: (SHAKES HEAD) He doesn't deal in methods.
C: ANGIER
D: How do you know?
T: CUTTER
N: (SLY SMILE) Because I hired him to try and find out Virgil's orange trick.
C: ANGIER
D: I don't know if I trust him.
T: CUTTER
N: He's a natural magician. Of course you can't trust him.
C: JULIA I think he's alright.
D: Angier turns to Julia. Smiles.
C: ANGIER
D: You think everyone's alright.
C: JULIA
D: Even you. Julia kisses Angier. Cutter rises.
T: CUTTER
N: And Mr.Angier...? (Angier looks up) Learn your aight lines- if I can see you sneaking a peck on your wife's ankle from the wings, the blokes on each end of rows 3 and 4 can, too.
S: INT. THEATRE, CONVENT GARDEN -- EVENING
N: Borden watches from the wings. Onstage, a magician, Virgil, locks a CANARY into a cage then covers the cage with a SHAWL. Borden notices a beautiful YOUNG WOMAN in the front row with a little BOY who is watching Virgil's act, spellbound. Virgil SLAMS the SHAWL down onto the table, as if nothing were beneath it, then WHIPS it away- BIRD and CAGE are gone. The little BOY begins to WAIL and CRY. Borden watches as the young woman tries to make him stop. Virgil takes the flower from his lapel, covers it with the shawl, and SNAPS it away- the flower has become the CANARY. The audience bursts into enthusiastic APPLAUSE, but the little boy is still CRYING INCONSOLABLY. Virgil takes bows and walks off, handing Borden the canary as he passes backstage. As the audience leaves, Borden climbs off the stage and hols the bird in front of the boy.
C: BORDEN
D: Look- he's all right. He's fine.
N: BOY (SNIFFS) But where's his brother? Borden is at a loss. He turns to the young woman.
C: BORDEN
D: Sharp lad, your son.
N: YOUNG WOMAN (LAUGHS) My brother. Borden smiles back.
S: INT. WORKSHOP -- LATER
N: Borden gently strokes the bird's feathered head.
C: BORDEN
D: You're the lucky one tonight. Borden walks to a wall of DOZENS of bird cages -- each one with an identical canary. He puts the bird into its cage and returns to the cart props. He taps on the top of the TABLE- a panel POPS open, revealing the FLATTENDED BIRD CAGE. Borden insefts a ROD into the bird cage and PRIES it apart. A TRICKLE of BLOOD emerges, dripping into a bucket below.
C: Borden SLAPS the cage.
D: And the FLATTENED CARCASS of the ORIGINAL BIRD slides out and SPLASHES into the bucket.
S: EXT. STAGE DOOR -- EVENING
N: Borden exits. The young woman, SARAH, is there with her brother.
C: BORDEN
D: Are you watching closely? Borden reaches to the Boy's ear. Casually produces a coin. The Boy marvels as he takes the coin then looks at Borden.
E: to the brother
C: BORDEN
D: Look closer.
E: CONT'D
C: BOY
D: It's got two heads. Sarah smiles. Borden crouches to address the Boy, grave.
C: BORDEN
D: Never. Show. Anyone.
N: The Boy looks at him, a little afraid.
C: BORDEN
D: They'll beg you and flatter you for the secret- but as soon as you give it up you'll be nothing to them. Understand? Nothing. The secret impresses no one- the trick you use it for is everything.
E: CONT'D
N: Borden looks into the boy's staring eyes. Then SMILES and pets him on the head. he stands. Sarah smiles at him.
C: BORDEN
D: Where do you two live?
E: CONT'D
C: SARAH
D: He lives with Mum.
C: BORDEN
D: And you?
S: INT. STAIRWELL -- EVENING
N: Sarah lingers at the top of the stairs to her flat. Borden tries to KISS her, but she pushes him back. He tests the LOCK of the open door.
C: BORDEN
D: Enough to keep me out?
C: SARAH
D: I think so. Wil I see you again?
N: Borden SHRUGS and turns to go back down the stairs. Sarah looks after him, about to change her min. Hesitates.
S: INT. SARAH'S FLAT -- CONTINUOUS
N: She closes the door and LOCKS it, smiling. After a moment she pads through living/kitchen area, draws back the curtain to her bedroom and SHRIEKS: Borden is there, smiling. Sarah moves towards him, giggling.
S: INT. TENLEY THEATRE -- NIGHT
N: Onstage, CHUNG LING SOO, 60's, wearing a long silk robe, HOBBLES painfully to the center of the stage. Clearly CRIPPLED. In the audience, Borden and Angier watch intently. Soo lays a silk SHAWL and a BARE TABLE. He WHIPS it up, revealing a BOUQUET OF ROSES. So repeats the trick again and again, producing a different object each time. Finally, with a drum roll, Soo whips the shawl aside to reveal a MASSIVE GOLDFISH BOWL, complete with GOLDFISH. To THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE, Soo bows and HOBBLES off the stage. Angier, clapping, shakes his head, utterly baffled. He turns to Borden. Who has a small, knowing, smile.
S: EXT. RESTAURANT -- NIGHT
N: Borden and Angier watch Soo being helped down from his carriege by HANDLERS who treat him with great gentleness.
C: ANGIER
D: You're wrong. It can't be.
C: BORDEN
D: It is. He carries the bowl between his knees for the entire performance.
C: ANGIER
D: but look at the man!
N: BORDEN (POINTS) This is the trick. This is why no one detectes his method. Soo hobbles into the restaurant, frail, and fragile.
C: BORDEN
D: Total devotion to his art... Utter self-sacrifice. It's the only way to escape this.
E: CONT'D looks at Angier
N: Borden SLAPS the bricks of the wall behind them.
S: INT. BEDSIT -- NIGHT
N: Julia, in bed, watches Angier, SHEET wrapped around him like a robe, HOBBLING. He pulls up the sheeyt- between his knees is a goldfish bowl.
C: ANGIER
D: I can barely lift this thing and it's not even filled with water. Or fish. He must be strong as an ox.
N: JULIA (INCREDULOUS) He's been preteding to be an cripple for years?
C: ANGIER
D: Any time he's in public. Any time he goes out. It's unthinkable.
N: Angier puts the bowl down with a flourish. Climbs into bed.
C: ANGIER
D: Borden saw it at once. I couldn't fathom it- living your whole life pretending to be someone else.
E: CONT'D
C: JULIA
D: You're pretending to be someone else.
C: ANGIER
D: I don't think changing your name compares.
C: JULIA
D: Not just your name- who you are, where you're from...
C: ANGIER
D: I promised my family I wouldn't embarrass them with my theatrical endeavors. Angier cuddles up to Julia.
C: JULIA
D: I came up with a name for you... "The Great Danton"
N: (ANGIER FROWNS) You don't like it? It's sophisticated.
C: ANGIER
D: It's French.
S: INT. BEDSIT -- DAY
N: Sarah unlocks the door, but has to PUSH against MAGICAL PROPS stacked against it- the bedsit is FILLED with DEVICES.
C: SARAH
D: Alfred?!
N: Sarah surveys the confusion- spots Borden across the flat deep in conversation with another man. Borden spots her-
C: BORDEN
D: We have our routine for Ackerman!
N: The other man turns- it is Fallon. SARAH (COLD) We haven't had the pleasure. Fallon nods. Borden comes over, holding a DUELING PISTOL.
C: BORDEN
D: Mr.Fallon is my ingeneur-
C: SARAH
D: Where did yo get all of-
C: BORDEN
D: Begged, borrowed and don't ask. Mr.Fallon's an enterprising soul.
C: SARAH
D: I need talk to you.
N: Fallon slips past Sarah with a nod to Borden. Exits. Sarah looks at Borden. TENSE.
C: SARAH
D: We can't afford to pay him-
E: CONT'D
C: BORDEN
D: We'll start making money once we have our audience-
C: SARAH
D: And until then? What I earn is barely enough for us.
N: BORDEN (SHRUGS) I'll give him half of my food. Sarah looks meaningfully at Borden.
C: SARAH
D: You're already going to be sharing it with someone else.
N: Borden looks at her, confused. Then realizes.
C: BORDEN
D: You're...?
C: SARAH
D: Having a baby.
N: Borden freezes. Then SMILES, taking her in his arms. She FLINCHES against the gun he is holding.
C: SARAH
D: What's this?
E: CONT'D
C: BORDEN
D: The trick to wake up Ackerman at the end of my audition.
C: SARAH
D: Your great trick? The "masterpiece that will make our fortunes"?
C: BORDEN
D: No. The world isn't ready for that one, yet. Borden moves to the bureau and starts LOADING the gun. Pouring in SHOT, then WADDING...
C: BORDEN
D: This is merely a run-of-the-mill daring and spectacular bullet catch- Borden drops the BULLET into the barrel...
E: CONT'D
C: SARAH
D: I'm not letting you get shot. Borden RAMS the bullet and charge down then removes the RAMROD and hands the pistol to Sarah.
C: BORDEN
D: It's perfectly safe. Shoot me. Sarah looks at Borden then down at the pistol. She aims at Borden. Then sims off, at a mirror beside him. BANG. Borden's hand SNAPS out to "catch" the bullet. The mirror is intact. Borden looks at Sarah, grave, as he reveals the bullet in his hand.
C: SARAH
D: Show me. Then you're not doing it. I can't raise a child on my own, Alfred. Borden looks at her. Takes the bullet from her and places it on the bureau.
E: Borden shakes head
C: BORDEN
D: The bullet goes in the gun. Then comes the ramrod. He takes the RAMROD and PUSHES it down onto the bullet, which disappears.
N: BORDEN (CONT'D)
C: AND VOILS-
D: He points the ramrod at Sarah- she pulls the bullet out of the HOLLOW TIP.
C: BORDEN
D: The buller's not even in the gun when the charge is fired.
E: CONT'D
N: Sarah looks at ramrod with disdain.
C: SARAH
D: Once you know it's so obvious.
N: Borden BRISTLES slightly. Takes the bullet back.
C: BORDEN
D: Yes, well, people still get killed perfoming it.
C: SARAH
D: How?
C: BORDEN
D: Sme smart-arse drops something down the barrel.
C: SARAH
D: Such as?
C: BORDEN
D: A penny, or a button. Or, of course, a bullet. But don't fret-
E: off worried look
N: Borden embraces her, putting his hand on her belly.
C: BORDEN
D: I'm not letting anything happen- I love you too much.
E: CONT'D
N: Sarah grabs his face, looking at his eyes, smiling.
C: SARAH
D: Say it again.
C: BORDEN
D: I love you.
N: SARAH (MATTER-OF-FACT) Nope. Not today.
C: BORDEN
D: What?
N: SARAH (SMILES) Some days, it's not true. Todayt you don't mean it. Maybe today you're more in love with magic than me. (OFF LOOK) It's alright. I like being able to tell the difference- it makes the days it is true mean something. Borden shakes his head, grinning.
S: INT. HOTEL ROOM, COLORADO -- NIGHT
N: Angier closes Borden's notebook. He looks across at a photograph of julia on the table. Reaches for his own diary.
C: ANGIER
D: Borden writes as if no one but he understood the true nature of magic...
E: V.O.
S: INT. CELL, NEWGATE PRISON -- DAY
N: Borden sits on his cot reading Angier's journal.
C: ANGIER
D: ...but what does he know of self- sacrifice more than the rest of us?
E: V.O.
N: Borden looks up from Angier's journal.
C: BORDEN
D: Bloody fool.
N: Borden TOSSES the book across the cell.
S: INT. EVIDENCE ROOM, WARHOUSE -- DAY
N: A POLICEMAN opens the door for the Judge and Cutter. POLICEMAN (POINTING) It's all laid out down the end, you honour. The Judge NODS. The Policeman exits, LOCKING them inside. The Judge follows Cutter, approaching a collection of magical apparatus, including a MASSIVE CRATE. Cutter looks up at it with AWE, touching the side where it says "COLORADO SPRINGS".
C: JUDGE
D: What's in there?
N: Cutter OPENS it, revealing metal and glass MACHINERY within.
T: CUTTER
N: Angier's machine.
C: JUDGE
D: You built this, Mr.Cutter?
T: CUTTER
N: (SHAKES HEAD) Oh no. This wasn't built by a magician... it was built by a wizard. (OFF LOOK) A man who can actually do the things a magician pretends to... Cutter closes the crats. The JUDGE turns to other props.
T: CUTTER (CONT'D)
N: your honour, what will happen to these things when the trial is over? The Judge is staring at a large glass tank.
C: JUDGE
D: They've benn sold to a Lord Caldlo. An avid collector, apparently very interested in the case.
T: CUTTER
N: Don't let him take this. The Judge looks over. Cutter is touching the crate.
C: JUDGE
D: Why ever not?
T: CUTTER
N: It's dangerous.
C: JUDGE
D: I'm sure beneath its bells and whistles it's get some simple and disappointing trick.
T: CUTTER
N: The most disappointing of all- it has no trick. It's real. The Judge looks at Cutter. Smiles indulgently. Turns.
C: JUDGE
D: This is the tank Angier drowned in?
N: Cutter turns to look at the empty, smashed glass of the tank. Nods. Cutter indicates the top of the tank, where there is a PADLOCK. Cutter pushes down on a panel of the lid-
T: CUTTER
N: This lets the performer's hands reach the trick padlock... -a small section POPS open.
C: JUDGE
D: A standard magical apparatus for escapes?
T: CUTTER
N: With one important difference... Cutter grabs the PADLOCK. Rattles it.
T: CUTTER (CONT'D)
N: This isn't a trick lock... it's been switched out for a real one. The Judge stares at the tank, appaled.
C: JUDGE
D: What a way to kill someone. Why in God's name go to such lengths?
T: CUTTER
N: These are magicians, you honour. Showmen. Men who live by dressing up plain and sometimes brutal truths to amaze. To shock.
C: JUDGE
D: Even without and audience?
T: Cutter stares at the tank- INSERT CUT: ANGIER SCREAMING BUBBLES. CUTTER
N: There was and audience. (looks at Judge) See, the water tank had a particular signinficance for the two men...
S: INT. THEATRE -- EVENING
N: Onstage, A SIMILAR TANK FILLED WITH WATER.
T: CUTTER (V.O.)
N: A particular awful significance... Julia stands next to the tank. Milton adresses the audience.
C: MILTON
D: Which of you brave souls is willing bind this lovely young woman?
N: Milton gestures to Julia- the crowd goes wild. Julia makes a show of deciding. She picks up Angier and Borden, who are made up to look different from the last performance. As they leap up onto stage, Borden makes eye contact with Cutter in the wings- Cutter's is a WARNING GLANCE. As Angier ties Julia's ankles he can't resist tickling just under her toes- she KICKS him in the chin. Borden starts to wrap the rope around Julia's wrists in a particular fashion. Stops. Reconsiders. Julia NODS at him, encouring. Borden starts RETRYING the knot. Cutter watches. His hand checking for the axe handle. Borden tests the rope- it is tight. Julia gives him the sign with her eyes- he steps back. Angier rises to his feet, grinning at Julia. As she raises her arms to the hook, she can't quite hide her smile back at him. Milton gives the sign and Julia is HOISTED into the air. Cutter slips his STOPWATCH out of his pocket as Milton moes the tank under Julia's bare feet. Angier looks up at Julia. Proud. She stares out over the audience, preparing herself. Looks down at Angier, smiling... Julia PLUNGES into the tank- Milton SLAMS the lid shut- Cutter checks his stopwatch, hand caressing the axe handle... Milton raises the curtain around the tank, then circles it, working his "magic". Angier shifts a little. Time passing... Milton looks at Cutter- TOO MUCH TIME... Cutter GRASPS his axe and SPRINT at the tank- Milton RIPS the curtain down- Julia, one arm free, is CONVULSING... Angier and Borden look on in HORROR as Cutter SWINGS his axe into the glass- which CRACKS... cutter SWINGS again and again- the web of crackes GROWING, Julia's convulsions SLOWING, her eyes PLEADING with Angier's, until- CRASH- the glass gives way, FLOODING the stage- Cutter and Angier GRASP at Julia- FULL her onto the stage- Cutter ELBOWS Angier out of the way to POUND on Julia's chest- Borden wacthes, stunned, as Julia FLOPS, LIFELESS, onto the boards. Cutter looks up at Angier, stricken. Angier takes Julia in his arms, looking down at her staring eyes. He desperately BRUSHES water from Julias cheeks and forehead. Borden looks on, shen.
C: BORDEN
D: How often I've fought with my self over that night .. one half of me swearing bling that i tied a simple slip knot... the other half convinced that I tied the Langford double. I suppose I'll never know for sure-
E: V.O.
S: INT. HOTEL ROOM, COLORADO -- DAY
N: Angier looks up from Borden's journal, despairing.
C: ANGIER
D: How can be not know?!
N: Angier FLINGS Borden's journal across the room.
C: ANGIER
D: He must know what he did. He must.
E: V.O. CONT'D
S: INT. PRISON CELL -- DAY
N: Borden smiles as he reads Angier's dairy.
C: BORDEN
D: "How can be not know?!"
N: (STARTS LAUHING) Because, Angier, life is complicated, people are complicated, knots are COMPLICATED-
C: PRISONER
D: Shit it, Professor, or I'll shut it for you.
E: O.S.
N: Borden quiets. Looking at the journal.
C: BORDEN
D: How could I not know? How can you read my story and not understand?
E: V.O.
S: INT. COURTROOM -- DAY
N: Cutter sits in the CROWDED GALLERY. Borden, in the dock, SCANS the crowd. Finally SPOTS Fallon pushing to the front- he is alone. Borden stares at him. Fallon shakes his dead. Borden is prompted to stand by two GUARDS as the Judge enters. The JUDGE has a piece of black cloth draped over his wig.
C: JUDGE
D: Alfred Borden, you have been found guilty of the murder of Robert Angier. You will, in one month's time, be hanged by the neck until dead. May the Lord have mercy on your soul.
N: Borden barely reacts.
S: EXT. PRISON YARD, NEWGATE PRISON -- DAY
N: Borden stands at the fence with Fallon
C: BORDEN
D: They took her away?
N: (FALLON NODS) To the workhouse? Another slow nod. Borden closes his eyes with despair. Then opens them and hands Fallon OWENS' CARD.
C: BORDEN
D: Tell him I've reconsidered.
E: CONT'D
N: (OFF LOOK) It's for the best.
S: INT. DINING ROOM, CLIFF HOUSE INN, COLORADO SPRING -- DUSK
N: Angier stares down at the NOTEBOOK, making notes on a napkin. Through large windows a THUNDERSTORM batters Pike's Peak. Angier is the only guest in the hotel's massive dining room.
C: VOICE
D: Mind if I join you?
E: O.S.
N: Angier looks around. Alley is standing by the table.
C: ALLEY
D: Tesla sends me down here during the storms. Perfect excuse to come shere a drink with the Great Danton.
N: Alley sits, gesturing to a waiter.
C: ALLEY
D: Have you tried our Bourbon yet, Mr. Angier? It matches the scenery nicely.
E: CONT'D
N: (TO WAITER) Two of 'em. (TO ANGIER) Beautiful, isn't it? I do miss New York, though.
C: ANGIER
D: Why are you here?
C: ALLEY
D: The lightning lives here. And noit much else- our work is secret.
N: Alley glances down at the notebook and Agier's scribbles.
C: ALLEY
D: A cypher?
E: CONT'D
N: Angier nods as Alley lifts the cardboard notebook.
C: ANGIER
D: My profession also deals in secrets.
N: Alley looks at the gibberish on the pages of the notebook.
C: ANGIER
D: It's a rotating transposition that shifts every day of the dairy. Simple but time-consuming to translate once you have the five-letter keyword.
E: CONT'D
C: ALLEY
D: Which is?
N: Angier smiles as he reaches for the notebook.
C: ANGIER
D: We magicians have a circle of trust.
C: ALLEY
D: You have a circle of trust with someone whose dairy you stole?
C: ANGIER
D: Maybe I bought it.
C: ALLEY
D: Magicians sell their secrets?
C: ANGIER
D: It's how we pay for our retirements and how greats tricks outlive us.
N: Alley considers this. Taps the cover of the notebook.
C: ALLEY
D: You're hoping to find a great secretin there?
C: ANGIER
D: I've already found it. That's why I'm here.
N: Angier reaches in his pocket and removes his own, leather- bound journal. He tears a PAGE from it and hands it to Alley. Who unfolds it ans stares at it.
C: ANGIER
D: Tesla built one for another magician.
E: CONT'D
C: ALLEY
D: Why would you want the same thing?
C: ANGIER
D: Call it a professional rivalry.
C: ALLEY
D: Tesla has built unusual machines for unusual people, but he would never talk about it.
C: ANGIER
D: I understand discretion. I just want the machine.
N: Alley looks at Angier. Thinking.
C: ALLEY
D: Finish your drink. You'll have a special appreciation for our work.
C: ANGIER
D: I thought it was a secret.
N: ALLEY (SMILES) You're a magician. Who's going to believe you?
S: EXT. FIELDS, COLORADO SPRINGS -- NIGHT
N: The storm has abated. Angier's cane into the muddy ground as he follows Alley through the moonlit field. There are large glass GLOBES pushing out of the soil as if planted all around them. They stop in the middle of the field, looking down at the electric LIGHTS of the town.
C: ALLEY
D: We do our tests when the townspeople are asleep- Mr.Tesla doesn't want to scare anyone.
N: Alley checks his wacth by the moonlight.
C: ALLEY
D: Not long now.
E: CONT'D
N: As they watch, the lights of Colorado Springs DISAPPEAR.
C: ALLEY
D: Our equipment requires a great deal of current. Tesla eletrified the whole town in exchange for using the generators when we need to.
E: CONT'D
N: The field around them EXPLODES with DAZZLING LIGHT. Angier laughs out in surprise- the field is full of a thousand large LIGHTBULBS, all glowing together. Alley bends down and picks up the nearest lightbulb -- as he does, the light in it extinguises. He tosses the bulb to Angier. Except for the size, it's a normal lightbulb.
C: ANGIER
D: Where are the wires?
C: ALLEY
D: Exactly.
N: Angier bends and gently PUSHES the lightbulb into a random spot in the wet soil. The lightbulb FLICKERS on again.
C: ANGIER
D: Where's the generator?
C: ALLEY
D: You saw it last week.
C: ANGIER
D: But that must be ten miles from here.
C: ALLEY
D: Fifteen. And I have to ride all of them before I get to bed. I'll send word for you in a few days, Mr.Angier.
E: turns to leave
N: Angier bends to pick up his lightbulb. As he does, the light FADES in all of them, and the lights in town come back on. Angier is alone.
S: INT. BATHROOM, LONDON -- DAY
N: Angier has his head SUBMERGED in a sink full of water. He BURSTS FREE, GASPING- COLLA`PSES to the floor, SOBBING.
S: INT. BATHROOM -- LATER
N: Angier lays out MAKE-UP SUPPLIES. He takes out a BULLE. Places it on the sink next to a FALSE MOUNSTAGE.
S: EXT. PRINCE'S ARMS BAR AND THEATRE
N: Rough. Unwelcoming. Crowded. A small "stage" at one end: Borden works his way through the Chinese rings. The crowd is JEERING.
C: VOICE
D: Get out your gun, Professor!
N: Someone BURLS a bottle at the stage- it narrowly misses. Borden GLARES out into the audience. Pulls out his GUN.
C: BORDEN
D: A volunteer.
N: The crowd SURGES forward with EAGER VOLUNTEERS. Fallon scans the crowd, passing over too-eager and too-drunk before settling on a MOUNSTACHED MAN and bringing him up onstage. Borden LOADS the pistol, hands it to Moustache and steps backwards, pulling his coat apart, CHALLENGING.
C: BORDEN
D: Are you man enought, sir?
E: CONT'D
N: MOUSTACHE (QUIET) Yes. Something in Moustache's tone makes Borden looks closely- behind the moustache... Angier. QUIVERING WITH TENSION. Borden looks at the trembling gun. Then at Angier. Spreads his hands, inviting. BORDEN (SMILES) I think not. Angier purses his lips, straining to pull the trigger. INSERT CUT: JULIA'S FACE, SCREAMING BUBBLES... Angier's eyes are almost closed as he SQUEEZES the TRIGGER- Fallon HITS Angier JUMPS to Borden's side, GRABBING his BLEEDING HAND. The DROWS is SCREAMING, PUSHING for the door, os STRAINING for a closer look at Borden. Aniger, SHOCKED, melts into the crowd.
S: INT. PUB -- DAY
N: Angier sits at the bar. Staring. He raises his pint glass. Downs it, then STOPS, looking at the bottom- there is a PLAYING CARD. He loos around. Cutter is sitting at a table with two fresh pints in front of him. Angier heads over.
C: ANGIER
D: Never thought I'd find an answer at the bottom of a pint glass.
T: CUTTER
N: Hasn't stopped you looking. (ANGIER SITS) I heard about a booking. Nice little theatre. Good up-and-coming magician.
C: ANGIER
D: Who?
T: CUTTER
N: You.
C: ANGIER
D: You got me a booking? Why?
N: Cutter looks down into his beer.
T: CUTTER
N: Because I want to keep working... (looks up at Angier) And who's going to hire the ingeneur who killed Julia McCullough in front of a sellout crowd at the Orpheum?
T: Angier looks back at Cutter.
C: ANGIER
D: Someone who know that it wasn't your fault. Someone who knows Alfred Borden and his repertoire of exotic knots.
T: CUTTER
N: Heard he had a spot of bad luck doing a bullet catch South of the river. Angier looks down at the liquid in his glass.
C: ANGIER
D: To die like that. Locked in water... lungs screaming...
N: (SHAKES HEAD) What did she go through, Cutter?
T: Cutter watches Angier's distress. CUTTER
N: I knew an old sailor. Told me about a time he got pulled over the side tangled in the sheets... they dragged him out, but it was five minutes before he coughed...
T: Angier stares at Cutter. Hanging. CUTTER (CONT'D)
N: He said it was like... going home. Angier considers this. Collects himself.
C: ANGIER
D: Which knot did Borden tie that night?
T: CUTTER
N: He wouldn't say.
C: ANGIER
D: Wouldn't say?!
T: CUTTER
N: It was as if... as if he didn't know.
S: INT. WORKSHOP -- DAY
N: Angier and Cutter isspect a large empty room.
T: CUTTER
N: We'll have to whitewash the windows to cofound the more curious members of your audience... (LOOKS AROUND) But this should do.
C: ANGIER
D: We should see about an assistant.
T: CUTTER
N: I've made arrangements. Have you settled on a name?
C: ANGIER
D: Yes, I have. The Great Danton.
T: CUTTER
N: Hmm. Bit old-fashioned?
T: Angier smiles gently at Cutter.
C: ANGIER
D: No. It's sophisticated.
S: INT. ANGIER'S WORKSHOP -- DAY
N: Angier is sitting at a worktable, pensive. He is moving one hand across the other, making a ROSE appear and disappear. The windows have been WHITEWASHED and the room has filled with an array of magical apparati: cabinets, costumes, props. On the other side of the room Cutter watches as OLIVIA WENSCOMBE, 20s, equal parts grace and mischief, squeezes herself into a tall cabinet, looking past Cutter to Angier.
C: OLIVIA
D: What's so hard about this? Cutter leans into the cabinet and pops up a TRICK PANEl in the floor, revealing a tiny chamber.
T: CUTTER
N: In here, Miss Wenscombe. No point meeting Mr.Angier unless you fit. Olivia shrugs and hands Cutter her hat, then her thick skirts, and folds herself into the bottom of the box.
T: CUTTER (CONT'D)
N: Breathe as little as possible. Cutter closes the lid over her and walks over to Angier.
T: CUTTER (CONT'D)
N: Not much experience , but she knows the basics. She knows how to present herself and a pretty assistant's the most effective from of misdirection. Angier nods. There is a small SNEEZE from inside the cabinet.
T: CUTTER (CONT'D)
N: (SMILES) I suppose I should let her out.
S: INT. SARAH'S FLAT -- DAY
N: Sarah is frantcally REDRESSIN Borden's injured hand. BLOOD has SEEPED trough the bandages.
C: SARAH
D: I don't understand, Alfred. How can it be bleeding again?
N: She examines the wounds: 2 1/2 FINGERS ARE MISSING. The injuries are black, but wet and fresh.
C: SARAH
D: What have you been doing to it? It looks as had as the day it happened. We need to get the doctot back-
E: CONT'D
N: BORDEN (SNAPS) We can' afford the doctor back! A BABY STARTS CRYING in the bedroom. Sarah glares at Borden.
C: SARAH
D: You've woken her.
C: BORDEN
D: I'm sorry. I just need this to heal so I can het back to work.
N: Sarah looks at Borden. Reluctantly.
C: SARAH
D: Alfred, you have to face things. What tricks could you peform with this kind of injury?
C: BORDEN
D: Some of the card pulls, prop tricks... And the trick I've been telling you about. The trick they'll remember me for.
E: leans forward, excited
S: INT. ANGIER'S WORKSHOP -- DAY
N: Angier and Cutter at the workbench, examine a BIRD CAGE. Cutter is wearing a strange LEATHER HARNESS over his shirt it has LARGE SPRINGS and small PULLEYS on the back.
C: ANGIER
D: The bird cage can't be our climax- everybody knows it.
T: CUTTER
N: Not like this, they don't.
C: ANGIER
D: And I don't want to kill doves.
T: CUTTER
N: (SNAPS) Then stay off the stage. (glares at Angier) You're a magician, not a wizard- you have to get your hands dirty to achieve the impossible.
C: ANGIER
D: You sound like him.
T: CUTTER
N: (holds up cage) Put your hands on the sides...
S: INT. PANTAGE'S THEATRE -- DAY
N: A heavy, disinterested man slouches in the third row of the empty theatre with a newspaper- MERRIT, the stage manager. Onstage, Angier energetically YANKS coloured handkerchiefs from a hat and TOSSING them into the air. Olivia, in the glamorous, revealing costume of Magician's Assistant, darts back and forth PLUCKING the handkerchiefs from the air. Angier finishes with a flourish. Merrit shrugs. Angier places an ORNATE CAGE onto the table.
C: ANGIER
D: I need a volunteer.
N: Merrit rolls his eyes. Climbs to his feet. Angier produces a DOVE. Places it in the cage.
S: INT. ANGIER'S WORKSHOP -- DAY
N: Now Angier is wearing the harness. He places a dove in the cage and picks it up. Close on: HOOKS concealed on Angier's palm slip into CATCHES on the bars of the cage.
T: CUTTER
N: Hang on, hang on... Cutter reaches in and slips a NOOSE around the bird's ankle...
T: CUTTER (CONT'D)
N: There we go. Now you tell the volunteer to put his hands here... Cutter pleases his hands on the TOP and BOTTOM of the cage...
S: INT. PANTAGE'S THEATRE -- NIGHT
N: Merrit places his hands on the TOP and BOTTOM of the bird cage. Angier's hands are on the sides. Olivia reaches around Merrit to place her hands on the remaining two sides. Merrit looks up at Angier over his glasses.
C: MERRIT
D: You'd beat not be intending to hut this animal, Mr.Angier.
C: ANGIER
D: Of course not.
N: Angier raises and lowers their hands in a rythm...
C: ANGIER
D: And one, two... THREE!
E: CONT'D
N: The bird cage, and the dove, VANISH.
S: INT. ANGIER'S WORKSHOP -- DAY
N: Angier and Cutter have their hands on the bird cage. ANGIER ...THREE! The bird cage BREAKS APART, WHIPPING UP ANGIER'S FOREARMS. WHERE SLEEVES WOULD BE, YANKED BY THE HARNESS. Angier smiles.
C: ANGIER
D: Bloody marvelous, Cutter.
E: CONT'D
T: CUTTER
N: And the best part... Cutter reaches to Angier's armpit... pulls up the DOVE, HANGING BY ITS ANKLE, ALIVE.
C: ANGIER
D: Thought you said I had to get my hands dirty.
T: CUTTER
N: Someday, perhaps you will. I needed to know that you can.
S: INT. PANTAGE'S THEATRE -- DAY
N: Merrit nods, impressed, stepping backwards. Angier REACHES into Merrit's pocket. Removes a dove.
C: MERRIT
D: Very nice. Very nice indeed.
N: Olivia packs up the props. Cutter approaches from the wings. ANGIER (SMILING) I haven't had a chance to compliment you on your beautiful theatre yet, Mr.Merrit.
C: MERRIT
D: A lot more beautiful when it's full, Mr.Angier.
C: ANGIER
D: Don't worry.
C: MERRIT
D: You all say that. Why sould I worry? If your tricks don't get 'em in, someone else's will. Maybe someone willing to do a bullet catch or a water scape.
T: CUTTER
N: cheap thrills, Mr.Merrit. People hoping for an accident- and quite likely to see one, too. What would that do for your business? MERRIT (SHRUGS) You've got a week.
S: EXT. PANTAGE'S THEATRE -- EVENING
N: A line a PATRONS runs from the box office to the street. The marquee above the theatre reads: "THE GREAT DANTON PERFOMS FEATS OF MISTERY AND IMAGINATION"
S: INT. THEATRE -- EVENING
N: Angier is perfoming to a good crowd. He steps forward.
C: ANGIER
D: You sir, in the hat. Could you show us your handkerchief?
N: A MAN in the audience STANDS and pulls a HANDKERCHIEF from his pocket. He stares at it, CONFUSED. The audience LAUGHS.
C: MAN
D: This isn't mine.
C: ANGIER
D: Perhaps you'd be so good as to return it to the other man. He has yours.
N: Another man stands and pulls out a handkerchief. APPLAUSE. Angier dows and walks quickly off the stage, past the squad of DANCING GIRLS who run on to entertain in the break.
S: INT. BACKSTAGE -- EVENING
N: Cutter and Olivia are waiting for Angier as he comes off.
C: OLIVIA
D: I'm so nervous- I'm sorry, I'm making mistakes. Cutter quickly REMOVES Angier's coat...
C: ANGIER
D: The audience doesn't seem to be responding much, Cutter. Cutter puts he LEATHER HARNESS over Angier's arms...
T: CUTTER
N: This is a grand theatre with a sophisticated audience- They've seen most of these tricks before. But not this next one. You'll see. Cutter checks the SPRINGS of the harness and replaces Angier's coat. He spots a STAGEHAND poking his head around the flies.
T: CUTTER (CONT'D)
N: You! Piss off out it! The dancers are wrapping up.
C: ANGIER
D: Wish us luc, Cutter.
T: CUTTER
N: (SMILING) I'll have the champagne ready. Angier, followed by Olivia, steps out onto the stage.
S: INT. STAGE -- CONTINUOUS
N: Angier steps to the table center stage. Pulls out the bird cage. There are one or two groans from the audience. Angier SMILES as he produces a DOVE with a FLOURISH.
C: ANGIER
D: You've seen this one before?
C: HECKLER
D: Seen 'em all before, mate! Laughter.
E: O.S.
C: ANGIER
D: Well, I'll make it a little harder, shall I?
N: In the wings, Cutter smiles and nods at Angier's showmanship.
C: ANGIER
D: Two volunteers, please. A lady and a gentleman to hold this cage with me...
E: CONT'D
N: Hands go up. Olivia pulls an ELEGANT LADY from the audience.
C: ANGIER
D: I'll perform this feat in a manner never before seen by yourselves or by any other audience anywhere in the worth...
E: CONT'D
N: Olivi brings Elegant Lady onto the stage along with a RED- BEARDED MAN. The audience is getting interested. Angier is on role...
C: ANGIER
D: Any magician can make this cage disappear... that's why I'll ask this good lady and fine gentleman to place their hands firmly on the cage...
E: CONT'D
N: Olivia guides Elegant Lady's hands onto the sides of the cage. Red-beard places a hand underneath the cage.
C: ANGIER
D: ...to ensure that no trickery whatsover is employed.
E: CONT'D
N: Angier RAISES the bird cage. The audience is RAPT. Red beard's other hand appears on the top of the cage- it is MUTILATED, missing fingers. Angier FREEZES- looks up at Red Beard... IT IS BORDEN Borden SMILES as he WORMS his little finger into the cage mechanism... SNAP! HALP THE CAGE WHIPS UP ANGIER'S SLEEVE- THE OTHER HALF COLLAPSES ON THE DOVE AND THE ELEGANT LADY'S FINGERS- SHE SCREAMS- BIRD BLOOD SPLATTERS ONTO THE THREE OF THEN- THE AUDIENCE GOES CRAZY- Borden smiles at Angier through his blood-spattered fake beard and retreats into the chaos surrounding the Elefant Lady who is still SCREAMING as Angier tries to free her fingers from the mechanism.
S: INT. BACKSTAGE -- LATER
N: Angier and Cutter watch the STAGEHANDS clear the stage.
C: ANGIER
D: I should've spotted him.
T: CUTTER
N: You had a lot of plates spinning. Angier looks down at the harness in his hands.
C: ANGIER
D: Don't suppose they'll let us do this one again.
T: CUTTER
N: No.
C: ANGIER
D: So what's the climax of our show?
C: MERRIT
D: Show? You don't have a show.
E: O.S.
C: ANGIER
D: Mr.Merrit, we have a week's engagment-
C: MERRIT
D: To perform magic- not butcher birds and break my costomer's fingers! Clear out, anything here in the morning gets burned.
N: Cutter puts his hand on Merrit's arms.
T: CUTTER
N: Mr.Merrit-
C: MERRIT
D: It's done, John. I've hired a comedian. You know I hate comedians, which should indicate the may I felel about your friend's future as a stage magician.
N: Cutter nods. Merrit leaves. Cutter turns to Angier.
T: CUTTER
N: There are plenty of good theatres... if we can come up with another trick and change the name of the act-
C: ANGIER
D: The name stays.
T: Cutter sees Angier's resolve. CUTTER
N: Right. Well, the new trick will have to be irresistible, then. I've a couple of methods to try out, but we'll need a fresh angle on the presentation. Angier nods.
T: CUTTER (CONT'D)
N: If you need inspiration, there's a technical exposition at the Albert Hall this week. Scientists and engineers. That sort of thing captures the popular imagination.
S: EXT. ROYAL ALBERT HALL -- AFTERNOON
N: The large concert hall is surrounded by crowds and covered in banners advertising a Technical Exposition. Angier makes his way past a giant STEAM ENGINE and into the building.
S: INT. ALBERT HALL -- AFTERNOON
N: THe lobby if filled with displays and models. Angiers pokes around, looking thouroughly disinterested until he comes to an information booth plastered with illustrations of electrical bolts.
C: TICKET HAWKER
D: Would you like to know the future, sir? The man who kill change the world is speaking right now. Continents divided no more. Free, clean power. The mysteries of the world solved.
N: The posters show a tall, handsome man bathed in lightning and standing astride the world like colossus. In bold print IT SAYS: THE WONDERS OF "ALTERNATING CURRENT"...NIKOLA TESLA
S: INT. AUDITORIUM, ALBERT HALL -- CONTINUOUS
N: The hall is completely darkened, but bright blue FLASHES illuminate ANGIER as he pushes his way to a seat. On the stage, a tall rod capped with a steel ball is transmitting a steady, sparking stream of electricity onto a matched ball across the stage. A FIGURE walks around from behind the machine and the audience GASPS as a shower of sparks bounce off of his immaculate evening wear. This is TESLA- but Angier is too far from the stage to get a good look at him.
C: TESLA
D: With a system like this I could have the entire city electrified whitin two years.
N: The audience breaks into LAUGHTER. The spell is broken. Tesla must be a lunatic.
C: TESLA
D: Mr. Edison's direct current system is flawed and dangerous. With my alternating current devices-
E: CONT'D
N: Someone from the audience chimes in: AUDIENCE MEMBER (YELLS) Fraud. Angier turns to look. The man who called out is leaving he's not alone. Angier FREEZES, staring down at aisle- Borden is sitting there, RAPT, lit by FLASHES from the machinery on stage. As tesla continues his demonstration, Angier STARES at Borden.
S: EXT. STREET -- DAY
N: Borden walks down the street. Angier is following him. Borden meets Sarah, pushing a PRAM. Borden looks down at the baby then up at Sarah.
C: BORDEN
D: I love you.
N: Sarah smiles.
C: SARAH
D: See? Today, it's true.
N: Angier watches Borden kiss wife then his baby.
C: ANGIER
D: I saw hapiness...
E: V.O.
S: INT. HOTEL ROOM, COLORADO -- NIGHT
N: Angier writing in his leather-bound journal.
C: ANGIER
D: ...hapiness that should have been mine. But I was wrong.
E: V.O.
N: Angier glances at Borden's notebook sitting on the desk.
C: ANGIER
D: Reading his account I realize that he never had the life I envied.
E: V.O. CONT'D
N: Angier flips open the notebook. Staring at the coded writing.
C: ANGIER
D: The family life he craves one minute he rails against the next, demanding freedom. His mind is a divided one...
E: CONT'D
S: INT. PRISON CELL -- DAY
N: Borden sits on his cot. Reading Angier's journal.
C: ANGIER
D: His soul restless. His wife and child tormented by his fickle and contradictory nature...
E: V.O.
N: Borden is crying. He puts the journal down and jumps to his feet BANGING on the cell door.
C: BORDEN
D: Guard! Guard!!
N: The viewing slot slides open.
C: GUARD
D: What do want, Professor?
C: BORDEN
D: Paper and pencil. Please.
S: INT. PRISON LIBRARY, NEWGATE PRISON -- DAY
N: Te library is long and titled, with two long tables. It looks as if it used to be a latrine. Borden sits at a table. Writing on a stack of notepaper. His arms have been unbound, but long chains runs from his ellbows to where Sullen Gaurd sits smoking, craning his nek to read Borden's writing.
C: SULLEN
D: Let me see?
N: Sullen SNATCHES up the papers. Borden makes no move to stop him. The top sheet is a sketch of a cabinet.
C: SULLEN
D: I'm going to know all of the Professor's secrets.
E: CONT'D
N: BORDEN (SMILING) Only if I teach you how to read. Sullen mashes the papers into a ball and drops them.
C: SULLEN
D: Just stupid tricks, right? Haven't helped you get out of here-
C: )
D: Have they? Or can't you open real locks, Professor?
E: TUGS CHAINS
C: BORDEN
D: Perhaps I'm just biding my time. Perhaps one day I'll just hold up my
C: HAND-
D: Borden produces a RUBBER BALL in front of Sullen's face. Sullen stares.
C: BORDEN
D: -get you attention. Then quietly
E: CONT'D
N: SAY- (WHISPERS) "are you wacthing closely"... perhaps say a magic word or two... then I'll be gone. Borden VANISHES the ball, but FUMBLES it, it drops to Borden's feet. Sullebn LAUGHS as Borden SCRABBLEs around his ankles to retrieve the ball.
C: SULLEN
D: How'd you get so famous, then? Borden STANDS.
C: BORDEN
D: Magic. Borden TURNS, NO LONGER CHAINED. Sullen JUMPS to his feet to follow, but HIS ANKLE IS CHAINED TO THE TABLE. The other PRISONERS are LAUGHING and CHEERING.
C: SULLEN
D: Oi, Borden, get back here! Sullen FUMBLES with his keys as Borden takes a BOW. Another warder CRACKS Borden over the head with a TRUNCHEON. Sullen, now free, KICKS Borden in the ribs.
T: CUT TO:
N: CLOSE ON AN ADVERTISSIMENT: "the professor has DEFIED DEATH to return with a new SPECTACULAR!" Pull wider-
S: INT. ANGIER'S WORKSHOP -- NIGHT
N: A NEWSPAPER on the makeup table. Angier sits at the mirror. He hubs BROWN PASTE into his hair and then combs it out. Then he chooses a beard, seats it on his chin and begins to adjust it. He drops the BOTTLE of spirit gum as he looks in the mirror and sees OLIVIA standing behind him. ANGIER (EMBARRASSED) I thought you'd gone. Olivia shifts. Embarrassed.
C: OLIVIA
D: I don't really.... have anywhere to go. Angier slips the newspaper from the table.
C: ANGIER
D: You've been sleeping here?
C: OLIVIA
D: Cutter said it would be okay till we get another booking.
N: (BEAT) What are you doing?
C: ANGIER
D: Researching. Part of a magician's job is to watch his competition, to see what illusions they're-
C: OLIVIA
D: You're going to do something to that man, aren't you? Olivia moves closer. Angier is quiet.
C: OLIVIA
D: Cutter's hopig you'll let things life. He says if Borden thinks things are even between you then we can-
E: CONT'D
C: ANGIER
D: Even? My wife for a couple of his fingers? He has a child now. And he's perfoming again.
N: (BITTER) Borden is out there, living his life just as he always intended. As if nothing had happened. And look at me. I'm alone. And no theatre will touch me.
C: OLIVIA
D: Us. Olivia moves towards him.
C: OLIVIA
D: You're going to need a better disguise. Olivia reaches for Angier's beard.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. TINY, GRUBBY THEATRE -- NIGHT
N: Angier, almost unrecognizanle as a blonde, slips into the back of the theatre, which is as rough and unwelcoming as Borden's last venue. On the small raised stage, Borden works through his way through the Chinese rings with GLOVED HANDS to hide his damaged fingers. The tough crowd is JEERING AT HIM. Borden puts the rings down on a table and PICKS UP a bag.
C: BORDEN I need a volunteer.
D: Angier takes a few steps towards the stage. Borden produces a RUBBER BALL. he TOSSES the ball to Angier.
C: BORDEN
D: As you can see , it's just a rubber ball. But it's not normal at all. Angier examines the ball. Hands it back to Borden who shows no sign of recognizing Angier.
E: CONT'D
C: BORDEN
D: Thank you. Angier notices that two TALL BLACK CABINETS are standing twenty feet apart on the stage.
E: CONT'D
N: BORDEN (CONT'D) (TO AUDIENCE) You're not impressed? Borden BOUNCES the BALL on the ground and catches it.
C: BORDEN
D: It's a magic ball. Borden continues to BOUNCE the ball on the floor. The audience looks bored, waiting for something to happen.
E: CONT'D
C: OLIVIA
D: What happened?
E: V.O.
S: INT. ANGIER'S WORKSHOP -- NIGHT
N: Angier still in disguise, is slumped in an armchair, drink in hand. He is SMILING, remembering. Olivia, sitting on the workbench, waits for him to continue.
C: OLIVIA
D: What happened, Robert?
C: ANGIER
D: He had a new trick.
C: OLIVIA
D: Was it good?
N: Angier looks at her...
S: INT. TINY, GRUBBY THEATRE -- EVENING
N: Now it's CUTTER standing in the audience, watching. Onstage, Borden BOUNCES the ball over and over again.
C: ANGIER
D: It was the greatest magic trick I have ever seen. Borden walks to one side of the stage and OPENS the door to one of the cabinets. It's empty. He CLOSES it again and crosses the stage, BOUNCING the ball the whole way. At the far cabinet, Borden repeats the process, OPENING the door to the empty cabinet. This time, however, he leaves the door open. He steps forwards and GENTLY BOUNCES the ball SIDEWAYS, across the stage... Borden STEPS into the CABINET behind him, CLOSING the door. With no one on stage, the audience watches as the ball continues to BOUNCE across the stage. BOUNCE. BOUNCE. BOUNCE. The ball loses seep and height... Just as reaches the second cabinet, something IMPOSSIBLE happens.
E: V.O.
N: THE DOOR TO THE SECOND CABINET OPENS AND BORDEN STEPS OUT,
C: CATCHING THE BALL.
D: Cutter FLINCHES, then studies Borden. The audience is BEMUSED. Finally, a trickle of applause.
S: INT. ANGIER'S WORKSHOP -- DAY
N: Angier is talking to Cutter. Olivia is watching.
C: ANGIER
D: Did they applaud when you saw it?
T: CUTTER
N: Not very enthusiastically.
S: INT. TINY, GRUBBY THEATRE -- NIGHT
N: Angier is disguise, starts CLAPPING loudly, FIRMLY, as if he can't help it, LEADING the applause. Borden BOUNCES the ball once again, then BOWS deeply. The APPLAUSE peters out. Borden walks off the stage.
S: INT. ANGIER'S WORKSHOP -- DAY
T: Angier turns to Cutter. CUTTER
N: The trick is too good -- too simple- the audience harly knows what they've seen.
C: ANGIER
D: He's a dreadful magician.
T: CUTTER
N: He's a wonderfull magician- he's a dreadful showman. He doesn't know how to dress it up, how to sell the trick.
C: ANGIER
D: How does he do it?
T: CUTTER
N: He uses a double. ANGIER (SHAKES HEAD) It's not that simple. This is a complex illusion.
T: CUTTER
N: You think that because you don't know the method. It's a double who comes out at the end. It's the only way.
C: ANGIER
D: I've seen his perfom ir three times now, Mr. Cutter- the Prestige is the
N: SAME MAN-
T: CUTTER
N: IT'S NOT-
C: ANGIER
D: The same man comes out of the second cabinet. I promise you.
C: OLIVIA
D: It is the same man. They both turn to look at Olivia.
C: OLIVIA
D: He wears padded gloves to hide his damaged fingers, but if you look closely you can tell. Angier looks at Cutter.
E: CONT'D
C: ANGIER
D: He doesn't know how to sell his trick to an audience. But I do.
T: CUTTER
N: (NODS) It would give us our climax.
C: ANGIER
D: The man stole my life. I'm going to steal his trick.
T: CUTTER
N: We'll have to find someone who can look like you on a stage.
C: ANGIER
D: He doesn't use a double-
T: CUTTER
N: (IMPACIENT) I don't know how Borden does it, Robert. So either you wait for Borden to retire and buy his secret, or you can listen to how I would do this trick. (ANGIER NODS) Ang the only way I know is to find you a bloody good double. Angier smiles. Turns to Olivia, pointing to his face.
C: ANGIER
D: Take a good look- let's get out there and find me.
S: EXT. ROAD, PIKE'S PEAK -- MORNING
N: Angier, swinging his cane, walks slowly up the mountain road.
S: EXT. TESLA'S LABORATORY -- CONTINUOUS
N: The lab is illuminated by thirty fot STREAMERS of electrical DISCHARGE that pour from the base of the tower. Angier stops, fearful.
C: ALLEY
D: It's perfectly safe.
N: As Angier stares, a MAN begins to emerge from the very center of the CONFLAGRATION. Bolts SNAP and TRAIL after the man as he walks, in SILHOUETTE, towards Angier.
C: TESLA
D: So this is the Great Danton.
N: Tesla emerges from the ball of electricity, dressed as if he were on his way to the opera. He brushes SPARKS from the sleeve of his jacket as he extends a band to Angier.
C: TESLA
D: Mr. Alley has effused about your act to me on any number of occasions. Something you did with pockets?
E: CONT'D
N: Angier returns the handshake.
C: ANGIER
D: I saw a lecture you gave in London, several years ago. I'm flattered you agreed to see me. Tesla keeps hold as Angier's hand.
N: Angier, confused, does so. Alley hands him a lightbulb, which starts to glow as he grasps its metal base.
C: ANGIER
D: What's conducting the electricity?
E: CONT'D
C: TESLA
D: Our bodies, Mr. Angier, are quite capable of conducting, and indeed, producing energy.
N: Tesla release Angier's hand. The bulb goes out. Alley takes it from the Angier who looks at the palms of his hands.
C: TESLA
D: Have you eaten, Mr. Angier?
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. DECK, LABORATORY -- MORNING
N: Angier, Alley and Tesla are seated around a table on a decl overlooking a spectacular view. They are eating sandwiches.
C: TESLA
D: Alley has explained that you require a very interesting device.
C: ANGIER
D: I need something impossible.
C: TESLA
D: You're familiar with a phrase 'Man's reach exceeds his grasp'?
N: (MORE)
C: TESLA
D: It's a lie. Man's grasp exceeds his nerve. The only limits on scientific progress are these imposed by society. Tesla looks out at the mountains.
E: CONT'D off his look
C: TESLA
D: The first time I changed the world I was hailed as a visionary. The second time I was asked politely to retire. The world only tolerates one change at a time. And so here I am. Enjoying "retirement". Nothing is impossible, Mr. Angier. What you want is simply expensive. Tesla rises, washing his hands in a basin on a side table.
E: CONT'D gestures at laboratory looking at Angier
C: TESLA
D: Alley says you are a stage magician. If a built you this device, you would be presenting it only as an illusion?
E: CONT'D
C: ANGIER
D: If people thought the things I did on stage were real, they wouldn't clap- they'd scream. Think of saving a woman in half. Tesla nods. Considering.
C: TESLA
D: Mr.Angier, the cost of such a machine-
C: ANGIER
D: Price is not an object.
C: TESLA
D: Perhaps not. But have you considered the cost?
C: ANGIER
D: I'm noit sure I follow.
C: TESLA
D: I can make your machine, Mr. Angier. But I can also give you some advice...
N: (POINTED) Go home. Forget this thing. I can recognize an obsession. As Mr. Alley could tell you, I myself an given to one now and then. It will not do you any good.
C: ANGIER
D: Have your obsessions done you no good?
C: TESLA
D: At first. But I've followed them too long- I am their slave. Their whipping boy. And one day they may choose to destroy me. Angier looks into Tesla's eyes.
C: ANGIER
D: if you understand an obsession then you know you won't change my mind.
N: TESLA (SMILES) So be it.
C: ANGIER
D: Will you build it?
C: TESLA
D: I have already begun to build it, Mr. Angier. I hope you enjoy the mountain air. This will take time. Tesla disappears into the lab.
S: INT. GREEN ROOM DRINKING CLUB -- EVENING
N: The club is warm and dark. Olivia, Cutter and Angier make their way to the bar. Olivia points to the far end of the bar, to a TRAMP in tattered clothing, curled over a pint. OLIVIA (TO TRAMP) Gerry? The tramp sees Olivia, hoists himself up and spills his way down the bar to them. As he draws closer, we understand why Olivia has brought them here. Underneath the filth and matted hair, this man is SPITTING IMAGE of Robert Angier- HE IS PLAYED BY THE SAME ACTOR
C: OLIVIA
D: Mr. Angier, Mr. Cutter, I would like you to meet Mr. Gerald Root.
E: CONT'D
C: ROOT
D: A pleasure to meet you fine gentlemen.
N: Angier is staring a little too much. Root throws an ARM over Angier's shoulder and draws him in. ROOT (CONT'D) (WHISPER) Would you like for me to tell you a little joke? Angier smiles unconfortably. Sunddely Root WRAPS this hands around Angier's neck and begins to THROTTLE him. Cutter breaks it up and pushes Root back. ROOT (CONT'D) (YELLING) Are you laughing? Angier is shaken. Root picks up his hat off the bar and disappears onto the street.
C: ANGIER
D: He's out of his mind.
C: OLIVIA
D: He's an out-of-work actor- of course he's out of his mind.
T: CUTTER
N: He's perfect. A little work, mind you, but when I'm done with him he could be your brother.
C: ANGIER
D: I don't need him to be my brother. I need him to be me.
S: EXT. NORTH HILL -- DAY
N: Borden escorts Sarah and their TODDLER, a girl, up the three lined street. Borden stops abruptly. Crouches to his daugther.
C: BORDEN
D: Would you like to see a magic trick?
N: Borden reaches up and pushes a wayward LOCK a her hair over her ear. When his hands returns, it's holding a KEY. He stands, places the key in Sarah's hand.
C: SARAH
D: What is this for?
N: Borden takes her gently by the shoulders and turns her around until she's facing a modest two-story HOUSE. She looks down at the key in her hand.
C: SARAH
D: When I asked last week you said we couldn't afford.
E: CONT'D
C: BORDEN
D: You caught me in the wrong mood.
C: SARAH
D: But you want through all the-
C: BORDEN
D: Sarah, I'm allowed to change my mind, aren't I? The act is taking off, maybe soon I'll get us into a bigger theatre. Things will work.
N: Sarah turns and embraces her husband.
S: INT. EMPIRE THEATRE
N: The auditoruim is empty. Two doors is simple frames have been erected in the middle of the stage. Angier fiddles with one, opening it, walking through it. Olivia is watching.
C: OLIVIA
D: You walk through this one- then...?
N: Angier stands Olivia in front of the door. he pushes the door all way open. Suddenly, a TRAP-DOOR set into the floor POPS open. Angier JUMPS through it-
S: INT. EMPIRE THEATRE -- CONTINUOUS
N: Olivia gathers up her skirts and DROPS through the hole-
S: INT. BENEATH THE EMPIRE STAGE -- CONTINUOUS
N: -LANDING beside Angier on the straw matterss.
C: OLIVIA
D: Oof. Couldn't you find a softer one?
N: ANGIER (SMILES) It's not for sleeping on. Olivia looks around the below stage area.
C: OLIVIA
D: And Root goes up through there?
N: She gestures at a LIFT twenty feet away with a TRAP DOOR MECHANISM above it. Angier nods. Olivia looks at Angier.
C: OLIVIA
D: It's going to be amazing, Robert.
E: CONT'D
C: ANGIER
D: It has to be. Borden's trick is getting noticed. The place was packed today.
N: Olivia looks at him strangely.
C: OLIVIA
D: You went and saw his show again?
N: Angier looks away, embarrassed.
C: OLIVIA
D: You becoming obsessed, Robert.
E: CONT'D
T: CUTTER (O.S.)
N: Ready to meet yourself, Mr. Robert. Angier and Olivia look up to see Cutter at the trap door.
S: INT. EMPIRE THEATRE -- MOMENTS LATER
N: Angier and Olivia sit in the front row. Cutter beckons Root onstage. He's been clened up and dressed in Angier's stage costume. he TRIPS on his way across the stage.
C: ANGIER
D: All I have to do is keep myself stinking drunk all the time and no one will be able to tell the difference.
T: CUTTER
N: A little faith, sir. Could you favor us with a perfomance. Mr. Root? Root picks himself up and dusts himself off. Suddenly, ROOT HAS BECOME ANGIER. he is channeling everything from his facial expressions to his walk. Angier nods, starting to believe this might work. The illusion is PERFECT -- till he opens his mouth.
C: ROOT
D: You would drink, too, if you know the world half so well as I do.
N: Angier hops up onto stage, examining Root from different angles. Root starts APING his every movement. Olivia starts laughing. Angier is getting uncomfortable.
C: ROOT
D: Did you think you were unique, Mr. Angier? I have been Cassar. I have been Faust. How difficult could it possibly be to play 'The Great Danton?'
E: CONT'D
T: CUTTER
N: You can go back to being yourself. Root. For free.. Root looks challengingly at both men.
C: ROOT
D: I'd rather be him, for now. I find it amusing. Root WAVES his hands across his chest, in the same manner that Angier does onstage. He produces a bottle of Gin from thin air, and takes a long swallow and jumps down to Olivia.
T: CUTTER
N: Root has to keep a low profile-- anyone sees him the game's up. ANGIER (WATCHING ROOT) I don't know how you do these things, Cutter. I'm not sure I want to know.
T: CUTTER
N: Have you thought about what we should call the trick?
C: ANGIER
D: No point being coy. Borden calls his trick 'The Transported Man'? Cutter nods.
S: EXT. LEICESTER SQUARE -- EVENING
N: The enormous MARQUEE of the Empire Theatre: 'The Great Danton perfoms THE NEW TRANSPORTED MAN' Beneath it, a CROWD. Fallon amongest them. STARING up at the sign.
S: INT. EMPIRE THEATRE -- EVENING
N: Angier is onstage, nearing the end of his show, SMILING BROADLY as he pulls dozens of FLOWERS from thin air and tosses them to the crowd. APPLAUSE fills the theatre. The DOORFRAMES are wheeld out on either side of the stage. Angier approaches the edge of the stage to address the audience with a suddenly SOLEMN demeanor.
C: ANGIER
D: Ladies and gentlemen, much of what you've seen tonight can be termed illusions. Entertaining trifles of the sort you may have seen other magicians perform.
N: Angier puts on a TOP HAT.
C: ANGIER
D: Alas, I cannot claim this next feat as illusion. Watch carefully- you will see no trickery, for no trickery is being employed. Merely a techique familiar to certain citizens of the orient and various holy men of the Himalyas. Indeed, some of you may be familiar with this technique, but for those of you who aren't, do not be alarmed, what you are about to see is considered safe...
E: CONT'D
N: Angier gracefully TURNS and heads upstage to the right-hand door, opens it, SLAPS it to show that is sold. Then strolls through crossing the stage- -to the other door, which he opens, SLAPPING to show its solidity, then walking trough the frame. Angier removes his TOP HAT and THROWS it high into the air. It sails back down to him and he catches it. Angier THROWS the HAT again, even harder this time, and it disappears uo into the rafters. After a beat, it is clear it's not coming back down. LAUGHTER. Angier snaps his fingers and the hat is dropped back down to him. He catches it. Angier movies to the first door and THROWS HIS HAT in a HIGH ARC across the stage. He OPENS the door- steps behind it... The second DOOR, FAR ACROSS THE STAGE, IMMEDIATELY opens and ANGIER/ROOT EMERGES, REACHING UP TO CATCH THE HAT. BOTH DOORS SLAMS SHUT behind him. He puts on the hat. The AUDIENCE ERUPTS- A STANDING OVATION, Fallon the only one in his seat as Angier/Root takes his BOWS.
S: INT. UNDER THE STAGE -- CONTINUOUS
N: Angier, hearing the MASSIVE APPLAUSE, climbs off the straw mattress, PEERING up through the cracks in the floorboards. Smiling, Angier turns to the unseen audience and BOWS.
S: INT. DRESSING ROOM -- EVENING
N: Angier, Olivia, and Cutter are CELEBRATING their sucess. Empty bottles of champagne line the makeup table. OLIVIA (TOAST) To our achivement. They drink.
T: CUTTER
N: The manager said he's never seen a reaction like it. Angier smiles, rueful.
C: ANGIER
D: At least he got to see it. I spent the ovation hidden under the stage. No one cares about the man who disappears, the man who goes into the box. They care about the man who comes out the other side.
C: OLIVIA
D: I care about the man in the box. Angier turns to Olivia, raises his glass.
C: ANGIER
D: Thank you.
T: (TO CUTTER)
N: Maybe we could switch before the trick. That way I could be the Prestige and Root ends up below stage.
T: CUTTER
N: (SHAKES HEAD) The antecipation of the trick is everything- it needs your showmanship to built suspense. If Root opens his mouth, it's all over- he can't introduce the trick.
C: ROOT
D: of course I can. I'm the Great Danton. They turn. Root is lying behind a trunk, still in costume.
E: O.S.
T: CUTTER
N: Root, you bloody fool, get that costume and makeup off right now, anyone could walk in here! Cutter is SLAPPING Root to his feet. He grabs his collar and turns to Angier and Olivia.
T: CUTTER (CONT'D)
N: Congratulation, all. Cutter DRAGS Root out. Olivia slides onto the makeup table.
C: ANGIER
D: I suppose I should get more rest.
C: OLIVIA
D: Life is not full of these moments, Robbie.
N: Olivia pours him some more champagne.
C: OLIVIA
D: We've worked hard for this, and we need to celebrate properly.
E: CONT'D
N: Angier looks up at her with a gentle smile. She pulls him in closer and they KISS. She wraps her legs around him. They kiss again. Angier pulls back.
C: OLIVIA
D: What's wrong?
E: CONT'D
N: (SOFTLY) It is your wife? Angier shakes his head, distracted.
C: ANGIER
D: The trick isn't good enough.
N: Olivia stares at him.
C: OLIVIA
D: Didn't you see the audience?
C: ANGIER
D: No.
C: OLIVIA
D: Well, they loved it.
C: ANGIER
D: It's not as good as his trick.
C: OLIVIA
D: Borden's trick is nothing compared to ours. He doesn't have any style-
C: ANGIER
D: He doesn't have to spend the finale hiding under the stage.
N: Angier rises, turning out of her embrace.
C: ANGIER
D: I need to know how he does it.
E: CONT'D
C: OLIVIA
D: Why?
C: ANGIER
D: So that I can do it better. Angier turns to her. Looks her in the eye.
C: ANGIER
D: I need you to go and work for him.
E: CONT'D
C: OLIVIA
D: Work for him? Are you joking
C: ANGIER
D: You'll be my spy.
N: OLIVIA (TAKEN ABACK) We just got our start and you want me to leave?
C: ANGIER
D: It's how we advance. Angier moves to Olivia, placing his hands on her shoulders.
C: ANGIER
D: Think of it, Olivia... we've got people excited about Cutter's version of the trick- imagine what we could do with the real illusion. We'll have the greatest magic act anyone's ever seen.
E: CONT'D
N: OLIVIA (FRUSTATED) He knows I work for you.
C: ANGIER
D: Exactly why he'll want to hire you. He'll want my secrets.
C: OLIVIA
D: Why would he trust me? Angier thinks for a second. Then smiles.
C: ANGIER
D: Because you're going to tell him the truth.
S: INT. TESLA'S LABORATORY -- DAY
N: Alley shows Angier in. Tesla is sitting, reading.
C: TESLA
D: You must be curious to see what so much money had bought you, Mr. Angier.
N: Tesla RISES. Leads Angier to a back corner at the room and pulls a SHEET from a ten-foot tall apparatus- the ELECTRICAL MACHINE Angier used on stage in the opening of the film.
C: TESLA
D: Fitting that you should be here for the maiden voyage.
E: CONT'D
N: Alley FIRES a GENERATOR connected by thick cables to the machine. It RUMBLES into life, smoke pouring from the slats.
C: TESLA
D: Your hat.
E: CONT'D
N: Angier takes off his hat and tries to hand it to Tesla. Alley intercepts the hat and lays it on a chalk hasmark directly underneath the machine. He returns to the controls.
C: ALLEY
D: You might want to stand back.
C: TESLA
D: No, no. It will be fine. Mr. Alley, please proceed.
N: Without further ceremony, Alley FIRES the machine. Nothing happens. Then, as they watch, the GLOBE on top of the tripped FLASHES whits hot. BOLTS shooting out of it, wrapping themselves around the legs of the tripod. The CHARGE reaches a FREEZY and then emits a loud BANG, as if it has broken the sound barrier. Suddenly the room is still. Tesla walks forward. Looks down into the pit. Alley joins him at the edge of the pit. Angier, limping, is the last to arrive, locking into the pit- -at the TOP HAT, which hasn't moved an inch.
C: ANGIER
D: I don't understand-
N: Tesla STARES at the hat as if trying to melt it with CONCENTRARION. Alley pulls Angier away from the pit.
C: ALLEY
D: Perhaps it would be best if you left us to it. We'll see you next week?
N: Angier begins to protest but Alley gestures towards the door.
S: INT. BORDEN'S WORKSHOP -- DAY
N: A small, disused shop off an arcade, crowed with tools, cabinetry and props, windows plastered with playbills. Borden is sitting at a workbench, sleeves rolled up, working a lathe. Fallon enters, Olivia behind him. Borden looks back at her, turns back to the table, instinctively putting on his gloves. OLIVIA (LOOKING AROUND) Interesting workshop.
C: BORDEN
D: We make do.
C: OLIVIA
D: My name is Olivia Wenscombe.
C: BORDEN
D: I know who you are. Are you here to steal the rest of my show? Olivia sees one of the theatrical notices that litter the shop: "THE GREAT DANTON BREAKS RECORD WITH HIS ASTONISHING
N: NEW TRICK"
C: OLIVIA
D: No. I'm here to give your show what is missing.
C: BORDEN
D: And what might that be?
C: OLIVIA
D: Me.
N: BORDEN (TO FALLON) Wasn't I just saying that, Bernard?
C: A woman's touch.
D: Fallon leaves, closing the door.
C: OLIVIA
D: I've left Angier. I want a job. Borden sits there.
C: OLIVIA
D: I know you have no reason to trust
E: CONT'D
N: ME-
C: BORDEN
D: Why on earth shouldn't I trust you? The mistress of my enemy.
N: Olivia is taken aback. Chanes tack.
C: OLIVIA
D: Mr.Borden-
C: BORDEN
D: Alfred.
C: OLIVIA
D: Alfred. I'm going to tell you the truth.
C: BORDEN
D: Ah. The truth. A slippery notion in our life of work, Miss Wenscombe.
C: OLIVIA
D: I'm here because he sent me here. He wants me to come and work for you and steal your secret.
C: BORDEN
D: What does he need my secret for? His trick is top notch. The Great Danton vanishes and isntantly reappears on the other side of the stage -- mute, overweight, and, unless I'm mistaken, rather drunk.
N: Borden rises, moves closer to Olivia.
C: BORDEN
D: Tell me, Olivia. Does he like taking his bows under the stage?
E: CONT'D
N: Olivia meets his gaze.
C: OLIVIA
D: No. It's killing him. he's obsessed with discovering your method. He thinks of nothing else, and takes no pleasure in our sucess. I've had enough. There's no future with him. He sent me here to steal your secrets, but I've actually come to offer you his.
C: BORDEN
D: He has no secrets from me.
N: Borden stares at her, unsure.
C: BORDEN
D: And this is the truth?
E: CONT'D
N: She gives Borden a challenging smile/shrug.
S: INT. BACKSTAGE -- DAY
N: Cutter is fixing a prop mechanism. Angier approaches, in his undershirt, looks over his shoulder. Cutter glances up.
T: CUTTER
N: Best be getting changed for the martinee, sir.
T: - Angier nods. Cutter REALIZES. CUTTER (CONT'D)
N: ROOT! You're late. (SNIFFS) And even more drunk than usual. Get yourself below stairs, right away!
C: ROOT
D: No.
T: CUTTER
N: No?! Root looks at Cutter with genuine malice.
C: ROOT
D: We need to have a chat, Mr.Cutter.
S: INT. DRESSING ROOM -- DAY
N: Angier is applying his makeup. Cutter enters. Angier looks at him through the mirror.
C: ANGIER
D: We have a problem, Cutter. He holds up the paper, folded to an advertisement:
S: PANTAGES THEATRE- FROM NEXT WEEK- THE PROFESSOR WILL
N: DEMONSTRATE THE ORIGINAL TRANSPORTED MAN- ACCEPT NO CHEAP IMITATIONS!!!
C: ANGIER
D: He'll be perfoming right across the street.
E: CONT'D
T: CUTTER
N: We have a bigger problem. Root.
C: ANGIER
D: Don't tell me he fell over again.
T: CUTTER
N: Worse. He realized he can make demands.
C: ANGIER
D: He's blackmailing us?
T: CUTTER
N: In a word, yes. I'm surprised, to be honest- it usually takes them a lot longer to figure it out.
C: ANGIER
D: How much does he want?
T: CUTTER
N: It makes no difference- we have to stop doing the trick. ANGIER (WIELDS PAPER) Stop doing the trick? Look at this.
T: CUTTER
N: Look at yesterday's. And last week's, where they called you "London's premiere stage performer", not "magician" mind. Performer. Of any kind.
C: ANGIER
D: What's the point?
T: CUTTER
N: My point, Robert, is that you've climbed too high to get away with any kind of professional embarrassament. We're not doing any tricks we can't control. Angier considers this. Nods. Thinking.
C: ANGIER
D: Pay him whatever he wants, for now. We keep doing the trick till Borden opens, then we'll phase it out.
S: INT. BENEATH THE EMPIRE STAGE -- NIGHT
N: Root smokes a cigarette. PULL BACK to reveal he is standing on the LIFT beneath the stage... The trapdoor OPENS and Angier DROPS onto the straw mattress. He looks over to see Root finishing his cigarette. ANGIER (HISSES) Get up there!! Root smirks at Angier- TOSSES the cigarette and CATAPULTS up-
S: INT. STAGE, EMPIRE THEATRE -- CONTINUOUS
N: -onto the stage and STEPS/STUMBLES out from behind the door to LOUD APPLAUSE. Root has a SLOPPY GRIN as he STRUTS acroos the stage, milking the applause from every angle, blowing kisses, winking... loving it. He turns to Cutter in the wings. Blows him a kiss. Cutter GLARES. Then TURNS to a stagehand.
T: CUTTER
N: Get it down!
C: ANGIER
D: Cutter was always surprised how fast Root turned bad.
E: V.O.
N: The stagehand starts LOWERING THE CURTAIN.
S: INT. RESTAURANT, CLIFF HOUSE INN -- DAY
N: Angier sits with Borden's dairy.
C: ANGIER
D: We paid him enough to keep him in beer- you wouldn't expect him to rock the boat. Today I learned Borden's view on the episode...
E: V.O.
S: INT. TAVERN -- EVENING
N: The bar is dark and seedy, packed with an unpromising lot.
C: ANGIER
D: ...and his account suggests a reason.
E: V.O.
N: Root is hanging precariously from his barstool, head lolling towards his empty glass. He is in his own clothes, but cleaned up to look like Angier. A full PINT arrives in front of him. Root turns to face his benefactor- BORDEN. Root takes several large GULPS, staring at Borden. Suppresses a belch.
C: ROOT
D: To what do I owe the pleasure of this rather welcome pint of ale?
C: BORDEN
D: You are the Great Danton, aren't you?
N: Root gestures silence, glancing around them.
C: ROOT
D: Of course I am. But don't advertise it- I'll be mobbed with fans. And who might you be?
E: grins at Borden
C: BORDEN
D: Just a humble admirer. And fellow practitioner.
C: ROOT
D: Ah, very good. Root DOWNS the rest of his new pint, placing the empty glass in front of Borden with an emphatic THUNK.
C: BORDEN
D: Another?
C: ROOT
D: If you insist. I'm not perfoming tonight. Well, only one show, and, to be frank, my people pretty much run things these days.
C: BORDEN
D: You could probably do it blindfolded.
C: ROOT
D: Bloody good idea.
C: BORDEN
D: Have it.
C: ROOT
D: Thanks. A new pint arrives. Root sips.
C: BORDEN
D: Actually, there's something I might warn you about.
C: ROOT
D: Oh?
C: BORDEN
D: Well, it's your Transported Man illusion. Now, I'm noit claiming to know your method... but I had a similar trick in my act- and I used... (looks around,
C: WHISPERING)
D: ...a double.
C: ROOT
D: Oh, I see, very good.
C: BORDEN
D: At first. Then it went bad. You se, I hadn't counted on the fact that once I incorporated this bloke into my act, he had complete power over me.
C: ROOT
D: Complete power, you say?
N: BORDEN (NODDING GRAVELY) Weel, he was the secret, you see. And the more successful I became, the more outrageous his demands became. He practically backrupted me. In the end I had to stop performing the illusion completely. (looks at Root) You must be very careful about giving someone that power over you. Root looks at Borden. Drunken whells spinning.
C: ROOT
D: Thanks for the warning.
S: INT. STAGE, EMPIRE THEATRE -- EVENING
N: Angier is almost all the way through his act.
C: ANGIER
D: ...some of you may be familiar with this technique, but for those of you who aren't, do not be alarmed, what you are about to see is considered safe...
N: Angier takes his time, confident, MILKING IT. He throws his HAT into the air, catches it.
S: INT. UNDER THE STAGE -- CONTINUOUS
N: Angier DROPS ten feet to the concrete floor. But there is NOTHING to break his fall- He SMASHES painfully to the ground. CLUTCHING his leg in AGONY, he looks up and sees SOMEONE standing on the lift twenty feet away... BORDEN.
S: INT. STAGE -- CONTINUOUS
N: The first door slams shut. The audience turns their attention to second door. The door remains closed. The HAT falls gently to the floor. SILENCE, broken by a COUGH in the audience.
S: INT. UNDER THE STAGE -- CONTINUOUS
N: BORDEN bows to Angier- the LIFT ROCKETS BORDEN UP THROUGH THE STAGE FLOOR.
S: INT. STAGE -- CONTINUOUS
N: The second door OPENS, and BORDEN steps through, looking all around, CONFUSED, as if he doesn't know where he is. He looks back at the door, then picks up the HAT...
S: INT. UNDER THE STAGE -- CONTINUOUS
N: Angier looks at his leg- a nasty COMPOUND FRACTURE. As he chokes on pain he can hear LAUGHTER from the AUDIENCE.
S: INT. STAGE -- CONTINUOUS
N: As Borden mugs with the hat, trying it on and finding it too small, something is LOWERED from the flies above: ANGIER/ROOT, BOUND AND GAGGED, HANGS from a chain. A sign around his neck reads: "OPENING AT PANTAGE- THE PROFESSOR" Borden looks up behind him.
C: BORDEN
D: Great Danton, I must apologize! I simply had too much magic for my stage at the Pantages!
N: The Great Danton comes to rest three feet above the stage.
C: BORDEN
D: Pardon my intrusion!
E: CONT'D
N: Borden places the top hat and ANGIER/ROOT at a JAUNTY ANGLE. THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE and LAUGHTER. Borden BOWS, hops down off the stage, and walks up the aisle, bowing, enjoying it all the way.
S: INT. STAGE -- LATER
N: Cutter crouches over Angier, fixing a LONG SPLINT to his broken leg. Behind them, Root still hangs above the stage, groaning in protest.
T: CUTTER
N: I don't see how Borden found him- I had him under wraps, I was careful.
C: ANGIER
D: Well, he did.
N: Cutter helps Angier to his feet.
T: CUTTER
N: Sit, do you think it might be her? Olivia? Angier stops to look at Cutter.
C: ANGIER
D: No. I don't.
T: Cutter gestures at Root. CUTTER Shall we cut him down?
C: ANGIER
D: He's the Great Danton. Let him cut himself down.
S: EXT. PANTAGE'S THEATRE -- NIGHT
N: Angier, thinly disguised, leg in long metal brace, pushes through the crowd outside the box office. The marquee: The Professor Performs His Masterpiece- THE ORIGINAL TRANSPORTED MAN!! On the box office: SOLD OUT THRU SUNDAY. Angier STARES.
C: SCALPER
D: Need tickets, sir?
E: O.S.
N: Angier turns to the SCALPER. Nods.
S: INT. PANTAGE'S THEATRE -- EVENING
N: Angier slumps into a seat at the back of the PACKED theatre. ONSTAGE: Borden works through his show with a SUPERIOR DEGREE OF SHOWMANSHIP, even cracking a smile when called for. Working WITHOUT GLOVES, he makes much of performing tricks ONE-HANDED. He is assisted by Olivia, who looks STUNNING. Borden performs ths Transported Man. Borden HAS DRESSED IT UP WITH ELECTRICAL APPARATUS. Two large glass balls transmit SPARKS between one cabinet and the other along BARE WIRES. Another watches, anger rising as he watches Olivia's close RAPPORT with Borden.
S: INT. APARTAMENT -- EVENING
N: Olivia enters in to the darkness bedroom. She strikes a match and lights one of the gaslights... ...and SCREAMS as the gaslight illuminates Angier, sitting in an armchair, cane leaning against the arm of the chair.
C: ANGIER
D: You weren't expecting me?
C: OLIVIA
D: I was expecting you sooner, Robbie. Your message said "afternoon".
C: ANGIER
D: Well, it takes a bit for me to get around these days...
N: Angier RAPS his leg brace with his cane. HOISTS himself up.
C: ANGIER
D: He's taken everything from me. My wife, my career... now you.
E: CONT'D
C: OLIVIA
D: What do you mean? You sent me to-
N: Angier takes her by the shoulders, ROUGHLY.
C: ANGIER
D: I sent you to steal his secret- not to improve his act-
C: OLIVIA
D: That's my job-!
C: ANGIER
D: Or to fall in love with him!
C: OLIVIA
D: You abandoned me to him!
N: Angier SLAPS her. She shakes her head at him.
C: OLIVIA
D: I did everything you asked.
E: CONT'D
N: ANGIER (CHALLENGING) Yes? Then how does he do it?!
C: OLIVIA
D: Cutter was right- it's a double.
N: Angier shakes his head, furious.
C: ANGIER
D: Of course Borden said that-
C: OLIVIA
D: He didn't say anything- he'd never say. I've seen things- make-up, glasses, wigs. We don't use any of it for the show, but I've found it hidden backstage.
N: ANGIER (SCORN) It's misdirection- he leaves those things lying around to make you think he's using a double.
C: OLIVIA
D: All the time? He doesn't know when
N: I'M LOOKING-
C: ANGIER
D: All the time, Olivia- that's who he is, that's what it takes- he lives his act, don't you see?!
N: (BEAT) And just because you're sleeping with him doesn't mean he trusts you. Olivia glares athim, tears forming in her eyes.
C: OLIVIA
D: You thing you can see everything, don't you?
N: She moves to her bed, REACHING below the mattress.
C: OLIVIA
D: But the Great Danton, is a blind fool.
E: CONT'D
N: Olivia tosses something at Angier: a CARDBOARD-BOUND NOTEBOOK.
C: OLIVIA
D: His notebook.
E: CONT'D
N: Angier starts leafing desperately through pages.
C: ANGIER
D: You stole it?
C: OLIVIA
D: I borrowed it for tonight. I thought you'd be able to translate some of it, but now I realize-
C: ANGIER
D: I can't.
N: OLIVIA (SCORN) You can't.
C: ANGIER
D: Olivia, no one could-
N: (STUDIES PAGES) It's a cypher- with a transposition that probably shifts every day of the diary. Even with the keyword it would take months to decode...
C: OLIVIA
D: And without the keyword?
C: ANGIER
D: Perhaps never. We'll see.
N: Angier puts the cardboard-bound notebook into his pocket. Olivia, worried, holds out her hand for the notebook.
C: OLIVIA
D: No, we won't- if I don't get that back tomorrow morning, he'll know I took it.
N: Angier looks at her, incredulous.
C: ANGIER
D: You can'r possibly think I'd let this go? This is his diary, Olivia. All of his secrets are right here, in my hands.
N: OLIVIA (PLEADING) Don't do this do me, Robert! ANGIER (SHRUGS) Leave him.
C: OLIVIA
D: He knows where I live!
C: ANGIER
D: I need to know his method.
N: OLIVIA (DESPERATE) It won't get your wife back, Robert.
C: ANGIER
D: I don't care about my wife- I care about his secret!
N: Angier stops, realizing what he said. Calms himself.
C: ANGIER
D: Look, I'll go to his workshop and stage a break-in-
E: CONT'D
C: OLIVIA
D: He'll know it was you-
N: Angier puts his hands GENTLY on her shoulders.
C: ANGIER
D: Yes, me, not you. Understand?
N: Olivia nods, crying. Still scared. Angier drags his leg to the door. She watches him go, torn.
C: OLIVIA
D: Robert? I have fallen in love with him. Angier looks at her, sympathetic.
C: ANGIER
D: Then I know how hard this had been hard for you.
S: INT. BORDEN'S WORKSHOP -- DAY
N: CLOSE ON: SHATTERED GLASS, BROKEN PROPS AND CABINETRY. Borden and Fallon survey the WRECKAGE of their shop. Borden looks at Fallon.
C: BORDEN
D: Notebook. Fallon nods. Borden sighs. Weary.
C: BORDEN
D: Then he's just getting started.
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. STAGEDOOR, PANTAGE'S THEATRE -- EVENING
N: A small CROWD of autograph SEEKERS crowd the stagedoor. A BODYGUARD steps through the door and begins unshering them away as Fallon and Borden follow him through the door. The bodyguard hold the door to a carriage open and Fallon steps up. Borden stops at the door.
C: BORDEN
D: I'm walking tonight, gentlemen. Fallon looks concerned.
C: BORDEN
D: Let him come. I don't care. Borden doffs his hat and walks onto the crowd street. Fallon steps down, reaches into the bodyguard's jacket and pulls out a PISTOL. He checks that it's loaded and slips it into his own jacket. Then he sets off after Borden.
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. STREETS, WEST END -- EVENING
N: Fallon continues to follow Borden at a distance. Borden steps into a tobacconist's. Fallon stops and idles at the street corner. As Fallon watches, acrooss the street, another man STOPS. Fallon slips back around the corner and looks: It's Angier, leaning on his cane. Borden emerges from the tobacconist and continues down the street, a cloud of pipe smoke drifting after him. Fallon waits for Angier to set off after Borden, then follows both men from a distance. Borden crosses to the same side of the street as Angier. Fallon picks up his pace and tries to cross the street but is HELD UP for a second by passing traffi. As he reaches the other side, Borden is gone, but he sees Angier dissappear down and alleyway.
S: EXT. ALLEY -- CONTINUOUS
N: Fallon rounds the cornder and stops. The alleyway is EMPTY. -- he has lost them. Finally, he sees an open, darkned doorway towards the end of the alleyway.
S: INT. HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS
N: Fallon stops at the doorway, his gloved hand gripping te doorframe. Angier stands at the other end of the hallway, watching him. Fallon takes a step towards him and CRASHES through the rotten floor to the basement below.
S: INT. BASEMENT -- CONTINUOUS
N: Fallon drops heavily into an almost-vertical OPEN COFFIN. DISORIENTED, Fallon just glimpses CUTTER DROP THE LID INTO PLACE, shutting him in. Cutter starts NAILING it down. A GUNSHOT TEARS through the lid of the box. Cutter falls back, but is caught by Angier. Angier rolls Cutter off to one side. He is clutching at a BLOODY WOUND on his arm.
T: CUTTER
N: I'll live. (TO COFFIN) You save me the trouble to making you an air hole! Angie picks up the hammer and continues NAILING.
S: EXT. HIGHGATE CEMETARY -- MORNING
N: Borden picks up his way through the overgrown cemetary. He hears a KNOCKING and turns: Angier is behind him, RAPPING on a broken headstone with the head of his cane.
C: BORDEN
D: I'm impressed.
C: ANGIER
D: Why's that?
C: BORDEN
D: You're finally getting your hands dirty. This is what a good trick costs, Angier. Risk. Sacrifice.
C: ANGIER
D: The sacrifice, I'm afraid, is all going to be yours. Unless you give me what I want.
C: BORDEN
D: Which is?
C: ANGIER
D: Your secret.
N: Borden tries to gauge Angier's expression.
C: BORDEN
D: My secret?
C: ANGIER
D: Your method for the Transported Man. Fallon wouldn't tell me. In fact, he doesn't talk at all.
N: BORDEN (SHRUGS) You have my notebook.
C: ANGIER
D: Useless without the keyword.
N: Angier pulls a sheaf of writing paper and a pencil stub from his pocket. He offers them to Borden.
C: ANGIER
D: Write down your method Mr. Borden. Describe it in full.
E: CONT'D
N: Borden takes the paper and pencil and stares Angier in the eye, gauging him. Beat. Borden writes a SINGLE WORD on the top page and folds it up.
C: ANGIER
D: I want the method not the keyword- I don't even know if the secret is in you notebook.
E: CONT'D
N: Borden looks at Angier with a glint in his eye.
C: BORDEN
D: The keyword is the method.
N: Angier reaches for the folded paper, which Borden lifts out of reach.
C: BORDEN
D: Where is my ingeneur?
E: CONT'D
N: Angier pulls a SHOVEL free from a pile of dirt beside him. He STAKES it into a fresh pile of dirt in front of Borden. Borden looks at Angier, CONCERNED. BORDEN (CONT'D) IS HE Angier plucks the folded paper from Borden's hand.
C: ANGIER
D: How fast can you gid?
N: Angier movies away through the headstone, leaning heavily on his cane. Borden begins to DIG.
S: INT. HOSPITAL -- EVENING
N: Cutter is slumped in a chair by the wall, his arm bandaged. He smiles up at Angier, who sits down next to him.
C: ANGIER
D: How's the arm?
T: CUTTER
N: Still attached. Did you get your answer? Angier holds up the folded paper.
C: ANGIER
D: Our answer, Cutter. I haven't looked yet, I wanted you to share this.
T: Cutter looks curiously at Angier. CUTTER
N: I already know how he does it, Robert. The same way he always has, the same way we do. You just want it to be something more.
T: Angier looks at Cutter, uneasy.
C: ANGIER
D: Well, let's find out, shall we?
N: Angier opens the piece of paper. A large GRIN spreads across his face. he turns it to Cutter- it reads- -TESLA-
T: Cutter frowns, confused. CUTTER
N: What does it mean? ANGIER (EXCITED) It means, Cutter, that we have a journey ahead of us. To America.
T: Cutter watches Angier's excitement. Awkward. CUTTER
N: Robert, listen to me. (gentle, but definite) Obssession is a young man's game, I can't follow you any farther in this. Angier looks at Cutter, uncomprehending. He considers saying something. Stops. Restraining himself.
C: ANGIER
D: Then the rest is up to me.
S: INT. ELEGANT RESTAURANT -- EVENING
N: Sarah sits by herself at a table for two. Borden ENTERS with a swagger, Olivia beside him, Fallon behind. The MAITRE D' hurries over, signaling WAITERS. Sarah looks up. UNCOMFORTABLE.
C: SARAH
D: I didn't know we'd be joined for dinner.
C: BORDEN
D: Absolutely. We're celebrating.
N: The Waiters spirit another table and chairs to join Sarah's. Borden pulls out a chair for Olivia.

E: to wine waiter
C: SARAH
D: What are we celebrating, dear?
C: BORDEN
D: Well, we've hit upon a new trick, haven't we, Fallon?
C: OLIVIA
D: What trick, Freddy?
N: SARAH (BRITTLE) Yes, "Freddy". What trick? The WAITER presents a bottle of champagne. Borden nods without looking at it. BORDEN (LOUD) I'm going to bury myself alive. Every night. Then someone's going to come along and dig me up! OTHER DINERS are glancing over. The waiter uncorks the bottle with a muffled POP and pours champagne into Borden's glass. SARAH (TO WAITER) I'm not sure my husband needs-
C: BORDEN
D: Who are you to tell me what?!
N: Awkward silence. Olivia shifts in her seat. OLIVIA PERHAPS-
C: SARAH
D: Perhaps, Mr.Fallon, you might escort Miss Wenscombe home. My husband's being a bore. I see no reason for the two of you to suffer as well.
N: Fallon is on his feet, pulling back Olivia's chair.
C: OLIVIA
D: Good-night, Mrs.Borden. Good-night, Freddy.
N: They leave. Borden glares at his wife.
C: SARAH
D: "Freddy"?
C: BORDEN
D: It's my name.
C: SARAH
D: Not at home.
C: BORDEN
D: I'm not always at home.
N: Sarah is clearly on the verge of tears.
C: SARAH
D: Alfred, why are you being like this?
N: Borden, seeing her fistress, softnes.
C: BORDEN
D: Sarah, I had a terrible ordeal today. I thought I'd lost something very precious to me.
C: SARAH
D: What?
N: Borden looks at her speechless. Shrugs helplessly.
C: SARAH
D: I see. More secrets.
E: CONT'D
C: BORDEN
D: Secrets are my life, Sarah. Our life.
N: Sarah brushes away a tear.
C: SARAH
D: When you're like this, Alfred, I'm not seeing the real you. You're treating me like your audience. Performing. I can't live with that.
N: Borden just sits there. Offering nothing.

S: INT. CLIFF HOUSE INN
N: Angier walks to the reception desk.
C: ANGIER
D: I thought I had the place to myself.
C: MANAGER
D: Unexpected guests. Not very polite. A lot of questions. At first I thought they might work for the government.
E: looks out the window at the men
C: ANGIER
D: No?
N: MANAGER (LOWERS VOICE) Worse. They work for Thomas Edison. Angier starts out the windo at the men unloading equipment.

N: Borden turns to see Fallon show in Olivia.
C: BORDEN
D: His assistent come to us with a proposition...
E: V.O.
N: They start to speak as Borden's V.O. continues.
C: BORDEN
D: Obviously Angier has sent her, and told her to admit as much...
E: V.O. CONT'D
C: BORDEN
D: Tell me Olivia. Does he like taking his bows under the stage?
E: CONT'D
N: Olivia meets his gaze.
C: OLIVIA
D: No. It's killing him. He's obssessed with discovering your method. he thinks of nothing else, and takes no pleasure in our success. I've had enough. There is no future with him. He sent me here to steal your secrets, but I've actually come to offer you his.
C: BORDEN
D: He has no secrets from me.
N: Borden stares at her, unsure.
C: BORDEN
D: This is the "truth" you spoke of?
E: CONT'D
N: She gives him a sly smile.
C: OLIVIA
D: No. This is what he told me to tell you. Beat.
C: OLIVIA
D: The truth is that I loved him. And stood by him. And he sent me to you like he'd send a stagehand to pick up his shirts. I hate him for that. They sit there in silence, appraising each other.
E: CONT'D looks him in the eye
C: BORDEN
D: I can spot Angier's methods from the back of the theatre. What could you possibly have to offer me? Olivia smiles, moves to Borden, reaching for his gloved hand. Borden flinches, surprised.
C: OLIVIA
D: You may know he does his tricks... but you can't understand why no one can see that yours are better. She tenderly PEELS OFF his padded glove revealing his mutiladed hand.
C: OLIVIA
D: You hide this. I had to look closely to spot it when you performed the Transported Man. But this makes you unique... it shows the audience that you aren't using a double; You musn't hide it, you must display it proudly... I'm sure it takes great skill to perform illusions with one good hand.
E: CONT'D looks into his eyes looks at hand
N: BORDEN (QUIETLY) It does.
C: OLIVIA
D: Then let people know. You can be so much more then he is. I can show you how. Borden looks into her eyes.
C: BORDEN
D: I think she is telling the truth.
E: V.O.
S: INT. BEDROOM, BORDEN'S WORKSHOP -- NIGHT
N: Borden and Olivia are in bed together. It is raining outside. He watching her get out of bed and moves to the window to smoke a cigarette.
C: BORDEN
D: I think we cannot trust her. But I love her. I need her. We need her.
E: V.O.
C: BORDEN
D: How could he send you away? He must be blind, deaf and dumb. She smiles quietly at this.
E: CONT'D
C: OLIVIA
D: Robbie's blinded by his jealosy. He'd do anything for you secret. Sending me away was the least of it. Borden considers this.
C: BORDEN
D: Trust is not the point- love is the point... who have we ever trusted? To open myself to such a relationship,
E: V.O.
S: EXT. NARROW ALLEYWAY -- DAY
N: Olivia makes her way past crowed MARKET STALLS.
C: BORDEN
D: ...to the dangers of such an affair... I need assurances of fidelity. Of love. Fallon is SHADOWING her from a distance.
E: V.O.
C: BORDEN
D: But how to be sure when truth is layered like the skin of an onion? I know a way... she must help me rid ourselves of Angier. It is the only way to kow her mind.
E: V.O. CONT'D
S: INT. HOTEL ROOM, COLORADO -- DAY
N: Angier looks up from Borden's diary. Pale. He flips pages and pages forward TO THE LAST ENTRY...
C: BORDEN
D: Today my mistress proves her truthfulness. Not to me, you understand.
E: V.O.
C: BORDEN
D: I have been convinced since she led me to Root... today, Olivia proves her love for me to you, Angier.
E: V.O. CONT'D
N: Angier looks up from the notebook. Mind reeling.
C: BORDEN
D: Yes, Angier. She gave you this noteboook at my request. Yes, she led me to Root, and yes, Tesla is merely the key to my dairy, not to my trick. Did you really think I would part with my secret so easily after so much? Good-bye, Angier, may you find solace for your thwarted ambition back in yout American home.
E: V.O. CONT'D
N: Angier STARES at the pages, unblinking. JUMPS to his feet...
S: INT. TESLA'S LABORATORY -- DAY
N: Angier STRIDES up to the fence. ANGIER TESLA! (NOTHING) TESLA!! Angier takes his cane and starts running its METAL TIP across the eletrified fence- causing SPARKING and CRACKLING. ANGIER (CONT'D) ALLEY, GET OUT HERE AND LET ME IN!! Alley emerges from the building, consufed.
S: INT. TESLA'S LABORATORY -- DAY
N: Alley opens the door- Angier BURSTS IN past him, ENRAGED.
C: ANGIER
D: I've veen played for a fool!
C: ALLEY
D: Who by?
C: ANGIER
D: Tesla never made a machine like the one I asked for.
C: ALLEY
D: We never said he had.
C: ANGIER
D: You let me believe that he had, Alley!
N: (MORE)
C: ANGIER
D: You stole my money because your funding was cut off- you've been shooting sparks at my top hat, laughing at me all along while you use my money to stave off ruin. I've seen Edison's men-
E: CONT'D
C: ALLEY
D: Where?
C: ANGIER
D: In the hotel. I've every mind to bring them up here myself-
C: TESLA
D: That would be unwise, Mr.Angier.
N: Tesla is holding a cage containing a large tabby CAT.
C: TESLA
D: It is true, sir, that you are your one remaining financier. But we have not stolen your money...
E: CONT'D
C: ALLEY
D: Sir, my cat?
N: Tesla silences Alley with a tiny GLANCE.
C: ALLEY
D: When I told you I could make your machine I spoke the simple truth. Science is just a name for the art of rendering the exotic mundane. It has no boundaries- its very purpose is to destroy boundaries.
E: CONT'D
C: ANGIER
D: Then why isn't the machine working?
N: Tesla gives Angier the slightest of smiles.
C: TESLA
D: Because exact science, Mr.Angier, is not an exact science. The machine simply does not operate as expected. It needs continued examination.
C: ANGIER
D: Where did my top hat go?
C: ALLEY
D: Nowhere.
N: Alley points to the top hat, which is sitting on a workbench.
C: ALLEY
D: We've tried the damn thing a dozen times. And the hat went nowhere.
E: CONT'D
C: TESLA
D: Which is why we need to rey a different material. It may provoke a different result. Tesla opens the cage and points the open end at Alley.
C: TESLA
D: You don't expect me to handle the thing myself? Alley reluctantly reaches into the cage and pulls out the TERRIFIED CAT. He jumps down into the pit and secures the animal bu its collar to a eye-hook sunk into the ground.
E: CONT'D
C: ALLEY
D: You are responsible for whatever happens to this animal, Doctor. Alley pulls himself out of the pit, and Tesla CHARGES the generator. The cat stares up at the machine around it and HISSES. Without ceremony, Tesla FIRES the machine. As before, large BOLTS spew from the head of the machine, down towards the unseen cat. The machine build to a DEAFENING ROAR, then sputters out. Silence. The three men begin edging towards the pit. Suddenly, a terrifying SCREECH. The cat is still there, still tied to the hook. Alley breathes a sigh of relief and starts to free the car. Tesla looks frustated. Suddenly, the cat bursts free of Alley and ROCJETS through the open side door of the lab.
C: ANGIER
D: I'll go. Angier limps after the cat.
S: EXT. TESLA'S LABORATORY -- CONTINUOUS
N: Angier sees the cat disappearing along the edge of the building and into the forest beyond. Angier follows.
S: EXT. FOREST -- CONTINUOUS
N: Angier pushes his way through the dense undergrowth, trying to keep up, but the cat has disappeared.
C: ANGIER
D: Here, kitty, kitty.
N: Suddenly, a HORRIBLE SCREECHING reaches Angier. He begins to follow the noise. He stops at the opening of a tiny GLADE, no more than ten feet across. Two IDENTICAL CATS are fighting viciously in front of Angier. He tries to separate the two animals, and succeeds in grabbing one. The other cat RACES off. Angier takes a few steps after it, then FREEZES, staring at- TOP HATS. Clustered in a small glads. The first cat slinks its way through them. The SECOND BLACK cat jumps from Angier's hands- RACES into the glade, HISSING, SPITTING, CHASING the first cat into the WOODS BEYOND- Angier is left alone in the clearing, staring at the pile of dozens of IDENTICAL TOP HATS.
S: EXT. PORCH, TESLA'S LABORATORY -- DAY
N: The top hats are in a pile on the dark. Tesla is at the table, measuring two HATS with a pair of Calipers. Angier and Alley are watching.
C: ANGIER
D: So the machine was working?
C: ALLEY
D: I never bothered to check the calibration. The hat never moved.
C: TESLA
D: These things never quite work as you expect them to, Mr. Angier. That's one of the principal beauties of science.
N: Tesla looks carefully at the hat in his hands. It has a tiny TEAR on the inside of the brim. He picks up another hat. It has the same TEAR.
C: TESLA
D: We'll need a couple of weeks to iron
E: CONT'D
C: OUT THE-
D: -problems with the machine. I'll send word when it's ready.
E: looks at hats
N: Angier, still dazed, takes his cane and heads for the door.
C: TESLA
D: Don't forget your hat. Angier stops and looks at the pile of hats.
E: CONT'D
C: ANGIER
D: Which one is mine?
C: TESLA
D: They are all your hat, Mr. Angier. Tesla smiles at him.
S: INT. BORDEN'S WORKSHOP -- DAY
N: Borden's daughter, JESS, now four, runs into the room and tries to hop up into his lap. Laughing, he helps her up.
C: JESS
D: Are we going to the zoo this afternoon, daddy?
C: BORDEN
D: Daddy's got some business this afternoon.
C: JESS
D: But you promised.
C: BORDEN Did I?
D: Jess nods at him, solemly.
C: BORDEN
D: Then go to the zoo we shall. Borden holds the newspaper open for her to look at.
E: CONT'D
C: BORDEN
D: Who's that? A large advertisement features a picture of Borden: The Professor- England's premiere magician!
E: CONT'D gestures to newspaper
C: JESS
D: That's you, daddy? Borden picks up the girl off of his lap and stands.
C: BORDEN
D: Daddy has some errands to run. I'll be back before you know it, so get ready.
N: Borden walks to the door. As he does, Sarah enters, avoiding his eyes, then ducking him as he tries to kiss her. She reaches for the sherry decanter. He watches her pour. Sarah looks at him, eyes red from crying.
C: SARAH
D: We each have our vices. Borden moves to her, gentle concern in his eyes.
C: BORDEN
D: Sarah. Whatever you may think, your only competitions for my affections is my little girl. I love you. I will always love you, and you alone. She looks into his eyes. Fascinated.
C: SARAH
D: You mean it today.
C: BORDEN
D: Absolutely.
C: SARAH
D: That makes it so much harder when you don't. She turns from him. Borden watches her sadly. Leaves.
S: EXT. CANAL -- AFTERNOON
N: Borden walks along a disused strecth of industrial canal that snakes through the poorer neighborhoods of the city. Borden wanders into a tunel. Another man is waiting for him -- Fallon. Fallon hands Borden a folded piece of paper. He studies it.
C: BORDEN
D: More shopping. She doesn't like the smell of money, doesn't she? Fallon looks away. Borden tears up the paper.
C: BORDEN
D: The little lady wants to visit the Zoo, I thought you could take her. I'll do it tomorrow, if not. Sarah... she knows. At least, she knows things aren't right. (looks at Fallon,
E: CONT'D looks at his feet
C: PLEADING)
D: Help me with her. Try and convince her that I love her. Please.
N: Borden, embarrassed, pats Fallon on the shoulder and makes off down the path. Fallon sets off in the opposite direction.
S: INT. OLIVIA'S APARTMENT
N: Olivia, barely wearing a dressing gown, answers the door to Borden. She pulls him in, trying to draw him into a kiss, but he backs away.
C: OLIVIA
D: What is it. Freddy?
C: BORDEN
D: Please don't call me that. It's nothing, just... sometimes things seem... wrong.
N: Olivia looks at him. Cold.
C: OLIVIA
D: Freddy, I've told you before. When you're with me, you're with me. Leave your family at home where they belong.
C: BORDEN
D: I'm trying, Olivia. Please.
C: OLIVIA
D: I'll get dressed.
N: Borden watches her move down the hall.
C: OLIVIA
D: I saw Fallon hanging around my house again, after you left.
E: O.S. CONT'D
N: Olivia comes back in, half-dressed.
C: OLIVIA
D: There's something about him I don't trust.
E: CONT'D
C: BORDEN
D: You trust me? Then trust Fallon- he protects the things I care about.
E: off her look
S: EXT. CLIFF HOUSE INN -- MORNING
N: Angier walks out from the lobby. The two MEN he saw before are loading up their automobile. Smiling, laughing.
S: EXT. ROAD, PIKE'S PEAK -- MORNING

S: EXT. CLEARING, PIKE'S PEAK -- MOMENTS LATER
N: Angier rounds the bend in the road and comes into view of the laboratory. He FREEZES. The fence has been TORN DOWN. Beyond it, the LAB has been BURNED TO THE GROUND. The metal tower is in SMOLDERING PIECES. Everything else is gone. Angier notices a piece of metal lying in the road near him, and, using his cane, flips it over. It's Alley's sign warning trespassers to keep out.

N: Angier smiles up at him, absently and begins to leave.
C: MANAGER
D: Mr. Angier?
E: CONT'D
N: (ANGIER TURNS) I didn't feel it was necessary to tell the other men about the box. Angier stops.
C: ANGIER
D: What box?
N: The manager smiles.
S: INT. HALLWAY, CLIFF HOUSE INN -- MORNING
N: Angier follows the manager down a darkened hallway.
C: MANAGER
D: We never use these rooms in the off - season. It's a shame.

S: INT. BALLROOM, CLIFF HOUSE INN -- CONTINUOUS
N: Angier steps into the massive, elegant room. Standing on the dance floor is an ENORMOUS SHIPPING CRATE. Stencilled on one side "COLORADO SPRINGS" Angier walks up to the huge crate, awestruck. An envelope addressed to him has been stuck to the front. Angier stops it and begins to read.

E: V.O.
S: EXT. TESLA'S LABORATORY -- NIGHT -- FLASHBACK

D: But I seem to have outstayed my welcome in Colorado.
E: V.O.
N: The figure begin setting FIRE to the sides of the laboratory.
C: TESLA

E: V.O. CONT'D
S: INT. ABANDONED THEATRE -- NIGHT
N: The open crate sits empty at the side of a derelict stage. Angier, in shirt sleeves is running cables to the MACHINE, which is standing center stage.

E: V.O.
S: EXT. COLORADO SPRINGS -- NIGHT -- FLASHBACK
N: Alley holds open the door to a coach. Tesla steps up into it and looks back from the coach's open door, up the mountain.
C: TESLA
D: -Destroy it. Drop it to the bottom of the deepest ocean.
E: V.O.
N: High on the mountain, the laboratory is ABLAZE.

S: INT. ABANDONED THEATRE -- NIGHT
N: Angier moves to one side of the stage where he makes a hash mark with a piece of chalk.
C: ANGIER
D: Tesla's warning is as unheard as he knew it would be. Today I tested the machine...
E: V.O.

C: ANGIER
D: Taking precautions in case Tesla hadn't ironed out the kinks in its operation...
E: V.O. CONT'D

S: EXT. PRISON CELL, NEWGATE PRISON -- DAY
N: BORDEN stands at the fence again.
C: OWENS
D: Lord Caldlow was happy to hear that you'd reconsidered his offer.
C: BORDEN
D: Angier's journal, the "gesture of good faith"? It's a fake.
N: OWENS (SURPRISED) I assure you it's not.
C: BORDEN
D: It has to be- it refers to events that happened after his death.
C: OWENS
D: Clever predictions, I'm sure. The provenance of the journal is clear and under no doubt. It's written in Angier own hand, of which we have numerous examples. What makes you think it's a fake?
E: looks at Borden
N: Borden looks away, uncomfortable.
C: BORDEN
D: It doesn't matter.
N: Borden leans forward and stuffs ROLLED PAPERS through the fence. Owens takes them carefully.
C: BORDEN
D: My tricks. All of them.
E: CONT'D
C: OWENS
D: Including the Transported Man? Lord Caldlow will be very pleased.
C: BORDEN
D: No he won't. They're not complete- you only have the Pledge and Turn for each.
N: Owens leafs through the papers, annoyed.
C: OWENS
D: Without the Prestige for each trick these are wothless.
C: BORDEN
D: You'll get the rest after you bring my daughter here.

N: BORDEN (ANGRY) What do you want from me! Sarah pauses. Catches her breath. SARAH (QUIET) I want you to be honest with me. No tricks, no lies, no secrets. Borden calms. Looks into her eyes. Nods.
C: SARAH
D: Do you love me? Borden looks into her eyes. Sincere.
E: CONT'D
C: BORDEN

N: Merrit sits eating a sandwich. The door to his office opens and ACKERMAN strides in. Merrit STRUGGLES to his feet. MERRIT (SURPRISED) Mr. Ackerman. When they said...I didn't think you'd be here in person. Ackerman sits without being asked to.

C: ANGIER
D: Ladies and gentlemen, my first trick of the evening is one that involves considerable risk. Anyone in the audience who would be irrevocable damaged by seeing a man drown should leave now, for when I tell you that the young lady who taught performing it, you will understand the seriousness of the danger involved.

C: ANGIER
D: In my travels I have seen the future, and it is a strange future indeed. The world is on the brink of new and terrifying possibilities. The audience RECOILS in terror as the MACHINE is STARTED and BOLTS fly from it. SMOKE drift over the audience. Borden inches forward in his seat. Angier stands in front of the machine, silhouetted by the FRENZY of electricity behind him. He TOSSES his cane to his assistant and steps into the machine. The audience SCREAMS as large bolts BLAST from the machine and wrap themselves around ANGIER'S ARMS and legs. Borden is watching very carefully. Angier is almost impossible to see as the machine builds to a climax, but, just before it does; Borden catches a glimpse of ANGIER'S
N: BODY FALLING THROUGH A TRAP DOOR. The machine sputters out. Angier has DISAPPEARED. The lights are dim. A FOLLOW SPOT FIRES into the BOXES, audience looks up with a gathering commotion- ANGIER IS STANDING ON THE RAIL OF THE ROYAL BOX, thirtyfeet above stalls. He smiles down at the audience.

S: INT. ABANDONED THEATRE -- CONTINUOUS
N: The blind stagehand wheel the tarp-covered box to two LARGE METAL DOORS in the floor of the auditorium and start hooking it up to a winch. The metal doors open with a metal HOWL...

D: They do this every night. After each performance? Fallon nods. Borden gets to his feet with a sigh. Turns to a POSTER on the wall- "The Great Danton Perform THE REAL
N: TRANSPORTED MAN- 100 SHOWS ONLY" He studies the image of Angier. There is a small DEVIL looking over his shoulder.
C: BORDEN
D: We're done. Let him have this trick. You're not to go back there. I don't need to know his secret. Leave him alone. Fallon puts on his hat with a shrug.

N: A packed house. Many hands raised. Move in on a BEARDED MAN, his gloved hand tentatively rising into the air. IT IS
C: BORDEN.
D: A GLAMOROUS ASSISTANT beckons Borden from the aisle. He shuffles along his row towards her. Embarrassed. Borden and four other VOLUNTEERS follow the Assistant down towards the stage... On which stands Angier, leaning on his cane, smiling. Looming over him is the large and complex ELECTRICAL MACHINE. Borden STARES at the machine as he mounts the stage. Borden, FASCINATED, and the other volunteers look over the vast machine. As Angier GESTURES theatrically at the various features of the metal and glass apparatus.
N: As the Assistant leads the Volunteers to the side of the stage, Borden slips through the gas at the side of the CURTAINS-
S: INT. PANTAGE'S THEATRE, BACKSTAGE -- CONTINUOUS

C: STAGEHAND
D: Where'd you think you're going?
N: Borden pulls off his beard.
C: BORDEN
D: I'm part of the act, you fool!

S: INT. BENEATH THE STAGE -- CONTINUOUS
N: Borden fumbles through the darkned area, lit by flashes and sparks through gaps in the boards of the stage above. He GASPS as a flash illuminates a STAGEHAND with SOLID WHITE EYES sitting nearby. Borden waves a hand in front of the Stagehand's face. He is BLIND. Borden moves on.
S: INT. PANTAGE'S THEATRE, ONSTAGE -- NIGHT
N: Angier, facing the audience, steps backwards into the machine. He looks up at the electricity sparking just above him.
S: INT. BENEATH THE STAGE -- CONTINUOUS

S: INT. PANTAGE'S THEATRE, ONSTAGE -- CONTINUOUS
N: The Machine sputters to a stop. Angier is GONE. The audience sits, WAITING.
S: INT. BENEATH THE STAGE -- NIGHT
N: Borden the tank, ANGIER IS DROWING. His rolling EYES fixed on Borden, he POUNDS desperetely on the thick glass, SCREAMING BUBBLES... Borden, HORROFIED, tries forcing the lif ot the tank open. It's sealed shut. He leaves the tank and begins searching around under the stage. He finds a SPANNER. Borden SMASHES again and again at the glass of the tank, which spiders, then CRACKS, and finally GIVES WAY. WATER bursts from the tank, sweeping Angier's body into Borden, and both of them onto gournd. Above them we can hear YELLING. Borden rolls Angier onto his side and POUNDS on his back. Water and blood OOZE from the man's lungs. His eyes are dilated and lifeless: ANGIER IS DEAD. Borden is frozen, unable to move. Cutter appears behind him, SHOCKED by what he sees. Borden turns to look at him, his eyes wild with confusion.
T: CUTTER
N: What did you do?
S: INT. MORQUE -- EVENING

C: OWENS
D: Mr.Cutter, if you needed to know where to deliver the items you surely could have just-
T: CUTTER

T: CUTTER
N: I suppose so, yes. Owens moves closer to the crate. Sees the COLORADO SPRINGS stencil.
C: OWENS

T: CUTTER
N: Perhaps if I dould talk to Lord Caldlow in person.

Angier stands for a moment, confused, staring at the ball, then COLLAPSES to the ground, clutching at his stomach. Fallon's BOWLER HAT breaks into the circle of light. he is holding a smoking pistol... Angier drops the ball and it rolls across the floor, coming to rest at Fallon's feet. But it is not Fallon's gloved hand that picks up the ball- -it is a MUTILATED HAND, WITH 2 1/2 FINGERS MISSING. Angier LOOKS UP: ALFRED BORDEN REMOVES THE BOWLER HAT AND TAKES A BOW. ANGIER (CONT'D) (WEAK) You- you died. Borden shakes his head. Realization sweeps over Angier like a nightmare.

C: ANGIER
D: Nothing? You never understood, id you? Why we did this?
N: (COUGHS) The audience knows the truth- that the world is simple. Miserable. Solid all the way through. But if you could fool them, even for a second, you could make them wonder.
