S: EXT. BARTON HOME - DAY
N: CLOSE ON: A HOUSE-ARREST ANKLE BRACELET.
S: CLINT BARTON (O.S.)
N: Okay, you see where you’re going? Let’s work on how to get there. Pan up to find...CLINT BARTON, with his daughter, LILA, coaching her as she notches an arrow in her bow.
S: CLINT BARTON (CONT'D)
N: Okay, good...tip down...bow arm out...three fingers-
C: LILA BARTON
D: Why three?
S: CLINT BARTON
N: ‘Cause two’s not enough and four’s too much-
C: LAURA BARTON
D: You guys want mustard or mayo, or both?
E: O.S.
N: CLINT TURNS. IN THE FIELD BEHIND THEM, his wife, LAURA BARTON sets up a picnic as COOPER and NATHANIEL play soccer.
C: LILA BARTON
D: Who puts mayo on a hot dog?
S: CLINT BARTON
N: We’ll both have mustard, hon! (to Lila) Okay. Draw back, deep breath... She lets loose. THUD! HER ARROW HITS NEAR THE BULLS-EYE.
S: CLINT BARTON (CONT'D)
N: Good job, Hawkeye. Go get your arrow.
C: LAURA BARTON
D: Enough murder practice! Soup’s on!
E: O.S.
S: CLINT BARTON
N: One sec, babe. Be right there! We’re gonna kill some hot dogs. We’re hungry. But when he turns back...LILA IS GONE. The bow and arrow lie at his feet. He stares.
S: CLINT BARTON (CONT'D)
N: Lila? Babe, did you see Lila- He turns to his wife, BUT SHE’S GONE. So are the boys. The soccer ball rolls to a stop near the picnic blanket. NO ONE CAN BE SEEN FOR A HUNDRED YARDS IN ALL DIRECTIONS.
S: CLINT BARTON (CONT'D)
N: Guys? Guys, come on... Clint walks toward the field, dread growing.
S: CLINT BARTON (CONT'D)
N: Laura? Clint breaks into a panicked run.
S: CLINT BARTON (CONT'D)
N: LAURA!
S: CLINT MELTS DOWN, SPINNING AROUND, FRANTIC...
N: MARVEL FLIP
S: EXT. SPACE - NIGHT
N: BLACKNESS. TITLE: “TWENTY-TWO DAYS LATER.” Soon, THE BENATAR tumbles past, adrift...
S: INT. BENATAR, GALLEY - NIGHT
N: TONY STARK and NEBULA play table-top football. She wins.
C: TONY
D: Good sport. Have fun?
E: offering his hand
N: Nebula studies his hand, confused. Finally she shakes.
C: NEBULA
D: It was fun.
S: INT. BENATAR, FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT
N: Tony, thin and haggard, kneels in front of HIS BROKEN IRON MAN HELMET. He hits a switch. A light blinks. TONY’S RECORDING: he stares directly into the “camera.”
C: TONY
D: This thing on? Hey, Ms. Potts. Pep. If you find this recording, don’t post it on social media. It’s going to be a real tearjerker.
S: EXT. SPACE - NIGHT
N: THE BENATAR sparks, adrift.
C: TONY
D: I don’t know if you’re ever going to see these. I don’t even know if you’re still...God, I hope so. Today’s day twenty-one, no...twenty- two.
E: O.S.
S: INT. BENATAR, GALLEY - FLASHBACK
N: NEBULA lasers shut Tony’s infected wound.
C: TONY
D: You know, if it wasn’t for the existential terror of staring into the literal void of space, I’d say I’m feeling a little better today. Infection’s run its course, thanks to the Blue Meanie back there. You’d like her. She’s very practical. And only a tiny bit sadistic.
E: O.S.
S: INT. BENATAR, GALLEY - FLASHBACK
N: TONY AND NEBULA MEND THE EMPTY FUEL CELLS UNDER THE FLOOR.
C: TONY
D: The fuel cells were cracked during battle, but we figured out a way to reverse the ion charge. Bought ourselves about 48 hours of flight time. Problem is that was about...49 hours ago.
E: O.S.
S: EXT. SPACE - NIGHT
N: FROM HIGH OVERHEAD, WE WATCH THE BENATAR DRIFT IN SPACE.
C: TONY
D: Which means, we’re dead in the water. A thousand light years from the nearest 7-11.
E: O.S.
S: INT. BENATAR, GALLEY - FLASHBACK
N: Tony hands Nebula the last of A PURPLE POWDER. She pushes it back to him.
C: TONY
D: Most of the quote-unquote ‘food’ and potable water ran out two weeks ago.
E: O.S.
S: INT. BENATAR, FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT
N: Tony stands on the flight deck, one hand resting on the glass, staring into the unknown.
C: TONY
D: Pep, I know I said no more surprises. But, I gotta say, I was really hoping to pull off one last one. But it looks like...well, you know what it looks like.
S: INT. BENATAR, FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT
N: Back to now. Tony records his thoughts into his helmet.
C: TONY
D: Don’t feel bad about this. I mean, actually, if you grovel for a couple weeks, and then move on with enormous guilt...I should probably lie down for a minute, rest my eyes. Please know, when I drift off, it will be like every day lately. I’m fine, totally fine. I’m going to dream about you. It’s always you.
N: Tony switches the helmet off.
T: TIME CUT:
N: NEBULA finds TONY SPRAWLED ON THE FLOOR.
T: TIME CUT:
N: Nebula helps Tony into Quill’s chair. Tony slumps, completely still. Nebula gives him his privacy. Move in on Tony’s face as...A LIGHT SLOWLY GROWS BRIGHTER. Soon, the entire flight deck glows as bright as a sun. Nebula appears from the galley, shading her eyes. Tony’s eyelids flutter. Finally, he opens them to see... CAPTAIN MARVEL (CAROL DANVERS) hovering in space.
S: INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, BATHROOM - NIGHT
N: STEVE ROGERS shaves. He studies himself in the mirror, exhausted. He’s about to tap his razor in the sink’s standing water, when... THE WATER RIPPLES. Steve stares a beat, puzzled. Then the lamp catches his eye...SWAYING GENTLY. Just then, a sound roars overhead. Steve turns...
S: EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND - NIGHT
N: THE MOON HANGS HUGE OVER THE EARTH. Then the silhouette of THE BENATAR races past, propelled by CAROL DANVERS. Below...STEVE ROGERS, BRUCE BANNER, AND NATASHA ROMANOV watch a flying woman guide the ship to the ground. Behind them, PEPPER POTTS walks up to the group.
T: TIME CUT:
N: Steve races up as NEBULA helps Tony down the ramp.
C: TONY
D: I couldn’t stop him.
C: STEVE
D: Neither could we.
C: TONY
D: I lost the kid.
C: STEVE
D: We...lost...
E: unable to say it all
C: TONY
D: Is Pepper...? 6
N: JUST THEN, PEPPER POTTS THROWS HERSELF INTO TONY’S ARMS.
C: PEPPER POTTS
D: Stay here, you stay right here-
C: TONY
D: I’m not going anywhere.
N: NEARBY, NEBULA watches the sad humans. ROCKET SITS BESIDE HER, GRATEFUL. She rests a hand on his furry head.
S: INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, WORKSHOP - DAY
N: RHODEY, TONY, STEVE, NATASHA, AND CAROL watch... A HOLO-DISPLAY ROTATING THROUGH FACES OF PEOPLE WE’VE LOST: WANDA. VISION. BUCKY. T’CHALLA. MARIA HILL.
C: RHODEY
D: It’s been twenty-three days since Thanos came to Earth.
N: TONY, weak, sits in a hi-tech wheelchair, IV dripping into his arm. He stares, taking in the loss: SAM WILSON. SECRETARY ROSS. SHARON CARTER. SCOTT LANG. HOPE VAN DYNE. HANK PYM. NICK FURY. At Fury, Carol bites back emotion.
C: NATASHA
D: World governments are in pieces, as you can imagine. But the parts that still work are trying to take a census. It looks like he did what he said he was going to do.
N: JANE FOSTER. ERIK SELVIG. WONG. DR. STRANGE. THE BARTON FAMILY. QUILL. DRAX. MANTIS. GROOT. PETER PARKER. Finally, Tony looks away. RHODEY turns it off.
C: NATASHA
D: Thanos wiped out fifty percent of all the living creatures on Earth.
E: CONT'D
C: CAROL DANVERS
D: Not just Earth.
C: RHODEY
D: You sure about that? 7
C: CAROL DANVERS
D: You never have to ask me that.
C: TONY
D: Where is he now?
C: STEVE
D: We don’t know. He just opened a portal and walked through.
N: Tony looks out to see...THOR on the patio.
C: TONY
D: What’s his deal?
C: ROCKET
D: He’s pissed.
E: O.S.
N: Tony turns to see Rocket for the first time.
C: ROCKET
D: He thinks he failed. Which, of course, he did. But there’s a lot of that going around, ain’t there?
E: CONT'D
C: TONY
D: Until this second, I literally thought you were a Build-a-Bear.
C: STEVE
D: We’ve been hunting Thanos for three weeks - deep space scans, satellites - we got nothing. Tony, you fought him-
C: TONY
D: Who told you that? I didn’t fight him, he wiped my face with a planet while a Bleecker Street magician gave away the store. There was no fight because he’s not beatable.
C: STEVE
D: Did he give you anything to go on? Clues, coordinates-
N: Tony stares, lost, barely acknowledging Steve.
C: TONY
D: I saw this coming, few years back. Didn’t wanna believe. I thought I was dreaming... 8
C: STEVE
D: Tony, I need you to focus-
C: TONY
D: And I needed you, as in past tense. That trumps what you need. It’s too late, buddy. You know what I need?
N: Tony turns to everyone, slightly unstable.
C: TONY
D: I need a shave and a burger, not a bowl of soup. And I believe I remember telling all of you, alive and otherwise, that we needed a suit of armor around the world, whether it impacted our precious freedoms or not-
E: CONT'D stands
C: STEVE
D: But that didn’t work out, did it?
C: TONY
D: I said we’d lose, you said we’d “do that together, too.” Guess what, Cap, we lost, and you weren’t there. But that’s what we do, right? Our best work after the fact? We’re the “Avengers”, not the “Pre-vengers-”
C: RHODEY
D: Tony, take it easy...
C: TONY
D: I’ve got nothing for ya, Cap. No coordinates, no clues, no strategies, no options. Zero, zip, nada. No trust. Here. You take this. You find him, you put this on, and hide. I’m fine!
E: rips out RT drops to his knees
N: Tony COLLAPSES. Rhodey catches him.
S: INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, CORRIDOR - DAY
N: CAROL, STEVE, AND NATASHA stare through GLASS DOORS at TONY IN A HOSPITAL BED, PEPPER AND BANNER AT HIS SIDE. RHODEY STEPS OUT OF THE HOSPITAL ROOM.
C: RHODEY
D: Bruce gave him a sedative. Should be out the rest of the day.
C: CAROL DANVERS
D: Take care of him. When I come back, I’ll bring a bottle of Xorrian elixir.
E: heading for the lab
C: STEVE
D: Where are you going?
C: CAROL DANVERS
D: To kill Thanos.
S: INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, WORKSHOP - DAY
N: NATASHA catches up to CAROL IN THE WORKSHOP.
C: NATASHA
D: Hey, hey, hang on. We’re sort of a team here. Between you and me, morale’s a little fragile.
C: CAROL DANVERS
D: Oh, I’m sorry. My fault.
N: Carol sees Steve and Rhodey catch up. She claps her hands.
C: CAROL DANVERS
D: All right, team! I’m going to go kill Thanos. Message me if you get any intel that can help. Otherwise, I’ll report back when he’s dead. Great work, everybody.
E: CONT'D
C: STEVE
D: Look, we realize “up there’s” more your territory, but this is our fight, too.
C: RHODEY
D: Do you even know where he is? 10
C: CAROL DANVERS
D: I know people who might-
C: NEBULA
D: Don’t bother.
E: O.S.
N: They all turn to see NEBULA in THE LIVING AREA DOORWAY.
C: NEBULA
D: I can tell you where Thanos is.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, LIVING AREA - DAY
N: STEVE, NATASHA, RHODEY, BANNER, ROCKET, THOR, and CAROL gather. NEBULA studies her robotic hand.
C: NEBULA
D: Thanos spent a long time trying to...perfect me. When he worked, he talked. About his Great Plan. Even disassembled, I wanted to please him. I’d ask, where would we go once his plan was complete? His answer was always the same: “To the Garden.”
C: RHODEY
D: You’re saying Thanos had a retirement plan.
C: STEVE
D: Where’s this garden?
N: ROCKET brings up EARTH on A HOLO-MAP. A BRIGHT SURGE OF ENERGY ENVELOPS THE PLANET (EMANATING FROM WAKANDA).
C: ROCKET
D: When Thanos snapped his fingers, Earth become ground zero for a power surge of ridiculously cosmic proportions. No one’s seen anything like it.
N: He shifts the map, crossing billions of light years, to...AN IDENTICAL SURGE ENVELOPING A MYSTERIOUS, ORANGE PLANET.
C: ROCKET
D: Until two days ago.
E: CONT'D
C: NATASHA
D: You’re saying he snapped his fingers again. Where? 11
N: Rocket zooms the holo-image toward a cluster of stars...
C: NEBULA
D: Planet is unnamed, but inhabitable. Rich atmosphere, good soil-
C: STEVE
D: A garden.
C: BRUCE BANNER
D: Thanos is there. And he just used the stones.
N: Steve eyes everyone. THOR FINALLY LOOKS UP.
C: BRUCE BANNER
D: You know, we’d be going short- handed.
E: CONT'D thinking of himself
C: RHODEY
D: Because he killed all our friends.
C: ROCKET
D: Are we saying they’re dead? We’re using that word now?
C: RHODEY
D: He’s still got the stones.
C: CAROL DANVERS
D: So, we take them. And we use them to bring everybody back.
C: BRUCE BANNER
D: Just like that?
C: STEVE
D: Yeah. Just like that.
N: No one speaks. Finally...
C: NATASHA
D: If there’s even the smallest chance we can undo this, then we owe it to everyone who’s not sitting here to try.
N: Everyone looks around the room...AGREED.
C: BRUCE BANNER
D: If we do this...why would it end any differently than it did before? 12
C: CAROL DANVERS
D: Because before you didn’t have me.
C: RHODEY
D: Hey, new girl. All of us in here are about that superhero life. Where’ve you been all this time?
C: CAROL DANVERS
D: There’s a lot of people in the universe. And they didn’t all have you.
N: THOR STANDS. He crosses to Carol and holds out his hand. STORMBREAKER WHIPS PAST HER HEAD, RUFFLING HER HAIR. Carol doesn’t flinch. Thor smiles.
C: THOR
D: I like this one.
N: Steve stares at the planet a long, deciding moment. Then...
C: STEVE
D: Let’s go get that son of a bitch.
C: SLAM TO:
D: TITLE: “AVENGERS: ENDGAME”
S: INT. BENATAR, FLIGHT DECK - DAWN
N: EVERYONE settles into their seats on the Benatar’s flight deck. STEVE WATCHES EARTH GROW SMALLER THROUGH THE WINDOW.
C: CAROL DANVERS
D: Trust me. You get used to it.
N: ROCKET looks around from the pilot’s chair.
C: ROCKET
D: Okay, who here hasn’t been to space?
N: STEVE, NATASHA, and RHODEY half-raise their hands.
C: ROCKET
D: Oh, you’re gonna hate this.
E: CONT'D
C: NEBULA
D: Approaching jump in three, two...
N: STEVE’S FINGERS TIGHTEN on the arm rest as...
S: EXT. BENATAR - DAWN
N: WHOOSH! THE BENATAR WARPS, LEAPING INTO JUMP SPACE.
S: EXT. SPACE - DAY
N: WHOOSH! THE BENATAR ARRIVES ABOVE AN OMINOUS, ORANGE PLANET. As the ship maintains orbit, CAROL flies toward the planet.
C: CAROL DANVERS
D: I’ll head down for recon. If I’m not back in fifteen, you’ll know I found him.
S: INT. BENATAR, FLIGHT DECK - SPACE
N: OUR HEROES wait on the flight deck, tense. NATASHA looks at STEVE, who’s staring at...A COMPASS: PEGGY CARTER’S YELLOWED PHOTO STILL RESTS INSIDE.
C: NATASHA
D: This is going to work, Steve.
C: STEVE I know it will.
D: Because I don’t know what I’m going to do if it doesn’t.
E: beat
N: JUST THEN, CAROL FLIES UP TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GLASS.
C: CAROL DANVERS
D: No satellites, no ships, no armies. No ground defenses of any kind. It’s just him.
E: OVER COM
C: NEBULA
D: That’s enough.
N: The Avengers exchange a look.
S: EXT. TITAN-2 - DAY
N: SMOKE CURLS FROM THE CHIMNEY OF A SOLITARY LODGE.
S: INT. THANOS’ LODGE - DAY
N: A POT BOILS OVER A FIRE. Then...THANOS LIMPS TOWARD IT, LEFT SIDE PARALYZED, arm blackened. A shell of his former self. He stirs the pot. Suddenly, AN ARMORED HAND BURSTS FROM THE FIRE, GRABBING THANOS’ GAUNTLET... PREVENTING THANOS FROM CLOSING HIS FIST. Thanos jerks back as HULKBUSTER SPRINGS INSIDE. CAROL AND RHODEY BASH THROUGH THE ROOF, PINNING THANOS’ ARMS. THOR crashes through the door, followed by the others. HE
T: SWINGS STORMBREAKER...CUTTING OFF THANOS’ HAND.
N: The Gauntlet lands at Rocket’s feet. He picks it up...and his face goes slack. He turns the glove toward the others. And we now realize...THE INFINITY STONES ARE GONE.
C: STEVE
D: Where are they?
N: Thanos doesn’t answer. CAROL PRESSES HIM TO HIS KNEES.
C: CAROL DANVERS
D: Answer the question!
C: THANOS
D: The universe required correction. After that, the stones served no purpose beyond temptation.
C: BRUCE BANNER
D: You murdered trillions.
C: THANOS
D: You should be grateful.
C: NATASHA
D: Where are the stones?
C: THANOS
D: Gone. Reduced to atoms.
C: BRUCE BANNER
D: You used them two days ago!
C: THANOS
D: I used the stones to destroy the stones. It nearly killed me. But the work is done. It always will be.
N: That lands, sickening. ROCKET SEARCHES, FRANTIC, NEAR TEARS.
C: ROCKET
D: No...they can’t be gone... 15
C: RHODEY
D: He’s lying.
C: NEBULA
D: My father is many things. A liar is not one of them.
C: THANOS
D: Thank you, daughter. Perhaps I’ve treated you-
N: SWOOSH. THOR’S AXE SEVERS THANOS’ HEAD FROM HIS BODY. IT HITS THE FLOOR, FOLLOWED BY THE THUD OF HIS HUGE FRAME.
C: ROCKET
D: What did you do?
N: Thor just stares, his long journey a failure.
C: THOR
D: I went for the head.
N: As Thor walks away, Steve looks at Thanos’ head on the ground. IT’S OVER. THEY LOST.
T: FADE TO BLACK.
N: OVER BLACK: “FIVE YEARS LATER.”
S: EXT. PORT OF NEW YORK - DAY
N: A CAR CRUSHER flattens an Audi. THOUSANDS MORE NEVER-DRIVEN CARS LIE STACKED ON THE DOCKS, WAITING THEIR TURN.
S: EXT. NEW YORK - DAY
N: A HUGE TARP flaps over the shuttered LINCOLN CENTER.
S: EXT. SHEA STADIUM - DAY
N: A TEENAGE GIRL rides her skateboard, alone in a weed-filled parking lot. Pull back to see THE EMPTY STADIUM BEHIND HER.
S: INT. BROOKLYN COMMUNITY CENTER - NIGHT
N: A POSTER SHOWS A SINGLE FIGURE STARING AT A GROUP OF SHADOWS. IT READS, “WHERE DO WE GO, NOW THAT THEY’RE GONE?” The bottom reads, “BROOKLYN SUPPORT GROUP, TUESDAYS 8PM.” A GRIEVING MAN speaks in A RECOVERY GROUP.
C: GRIEVING MAN
D: So, I went on a date the other day.
C: JIMMY
D: Good job, Bobby. Back in the game.
C: GRIEVING MAN
D: Thank you, Jimmy. First in five years. I sat there at dinner thinking, what are we even supposed to talk about?
E: to the group
N: STEVE ROGERS, thinner, older, LISTENS INTENTLY.
C: STEVE
D: What did you talk about?
C: GRIEVING MAN
D: Same old crap. How much things have changed. How much we miss the Mets. My job, his job. Then it got kind of quiet. He cried during the salads.
C: OLDER MAN
D: What about you?
C: GRIEVING MAN
D: I cried just before dessert. But I’m seeing him again tomorrow. So...
C: STEVE
D: That’s great. You’ve already done the hardest part. You took a jump, didn’t know where you’d come down. And that’s it, those little brave baby steps we’ve gotta take. To try to make us feel whole again, to find a purpose... I went into the ice right after I met the love of my life. Woke up seventy years later and...had to keep going.
E: to everyone
N: The group takes this in.
C: STEVE
D: The world’s been left in our hands. If we don’t do something with it...then Thanos might as well have killed all of us.
E: CONT'D
N: People nod, but Steve seems unconvinced by his own words.
S: EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - DAY
N: THE CAMERA ROTATES down from the sky onto a strangely quiet San Francisco, until it finds...A STORAGE WAREHOUSE.
S: INT. STORAGE WAREHOUSE, UNIT 277 - DAY
N: LUIS’ VAN sits in a storage unit, surrounded by boxes: “S. LANG, KITCHEN, S. LANG, CLOTHES.” THROUGH THE VAN WINDOWS, we see...HANK PYM’S QUANTUM TUNNEL. A MEANDERING RAT CRAWLS ONTO THE CONTROLS. IT ACCIDENTALLY STEPS ON A TOGGLE SWITCH and...A LIGHT GOES GREEN. FLASH. THE BACK DOORS OF THE VAN BLOW OPEN, revealing...SCOTT LANG, ANT-MAN suit shorting. He retracts his helmet, gasping.
S: INT. STORAGE WAREHOUSE, SECURITY OFFICE - DAY
N: A GUARD reads THE TERMINAL BEACH, by J.G. Ballard. He looks up at a monitor: SCOTT LANG holds up a sign, “HELP.”
S: EXT. STORAGE WAREHOUSE - DAY
N: A dented WAGON rolls over a speed-bump. Scott, in his old clothes, slowly wheels his belongings away. The Guard watches him go, puzzled.
S: EXT. SAN FRANCISCO, STREET - DAY
N: Scott walks A STREET OF ABANDONED HOMES.
C: SCOTT LANG
D: Hello?
N: He hears A CLACKING. A KID on a bicycle rides by, playing card wedged between his spokes. Scott waves him down. The kid stops.
C: SCOTT LANG
D: Hey. Kid. What happened here?
E: CONT'D
N: The kid says nothing. He just stares at Scott with a haunted look. Then he stands on his pedal and keeps riding. CLACK-CLACK-CLACK-CLACK-CLACK-CLACK-CLACK...
S: EXT. SAN FRANCISCO, GOLDEN GATE PARK - DAY
N: STONE MONUMENTS loom in a park. A small crowd mills. Reveal Scott looking over the monuments, lost.
T: TIME CUT:
N: Scott walks up to the obelisks. At the top, they read: “THE VANISHED.” Hundreds of names line the stones. He scans the “L’s,” finally finding, “SCOTT LANG.”
C: SCOTT LANG
D: What? Cassie...
E: realizing
S: EXT. MAGGIE LANG’S HOUSE - DAY
N: A winded Scott races up the sidewalk toward his old house. He leaps a bush, banging on the front door.
C: SCOTT LANG
D: Cassie! Cassie!
N: SOON, A TEEN GIRL opens the door, shocked. A very long beat.
C: CASSIE LANG
D: Dad?
C: SCOTT LANG
D: Peanut?
N: Scott wraps his arms around CASSIE LANG (14), now five years older than when he last saw her. She hugs him, CRYING.
C: CASSIE LANG
D: I thought you were gone.
C: SCOTT LANG
D: I’m sorry. I’m back...I’m back...I’m back... 19
S: EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, FRONT GATE - DAWN
N: Avengers Compound stands amidst overgrown grass. Rusty chains lock the gate. Faded signs warn: “RESTRICTED AREA. KEEP OUT.”
S: INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, LIVING AREA - NIGHT
N: NATASHA SITS SURROUNDED BY HOLO-SCREENS FEATURING CAROL DANVERS, RHODEY, ROCKET AND NEBULA, AND OKOYE.
C: ROCKET
D: We boarded that “highly suspect warship” Danvers pinged.
E: HOLO
C: NATASHA
D: And?
C: NEBULA
D: It was an infectious garbage scow.
E: HOLO
C: ROCKET
D: So thanks for the hot tip-
E: HOLO
C: CAROL DANVERS
D: You were closer.
E: HOLO
C: ROCKET
D: And now we smell like garbage-
E: HOLO
C: NATASHA
D: You get a reading on those tremors?
E: to Okoye
C: OKOYE
D: Minor subduction in the African plate.
E: HOLO
C: NATASHA
D: Do we have a visual? How are you handling it?
C: OKOYE
D: Nat. It was a mild earthquake. In the ocean. We handle it by not handling it.
E: HOLO
N: Natasha looks burdened. Rhodey steps in.
C: RHODEY
D: I can have NASA redirect a satellite, do a sweep just to make sure.
E: HOLO
C: NATASHA
D: Thanks. Carol, you’re still coming our way next month?
C: CAROL DANVERS
D: Not likely.
E: HOLO
C: ROCKET
D: Getting another haircut?
E: HOLO
C: CAROL DANVERS
D: Listen, fur-face, I’m covering a lot of territory out here. The things that have been happening on Earth have been happening everywhere else. On thousands of planets. You might not see me for a long time.
E: HOLO
C: NATASHA
D: All right. Everybody keep keeping their eyes open. This channel’s always active. Anything goes sideways, anyone makes trouble where they shouldn’t, it comes through me.
N: They ad lib their goodbyes as they sign off, except Rhodey.
C: NATASHA
D: What’s up? Where are you?
E: CONT'D
C: RHODEY
D: Mexico. Got some news.
E: HOLO
C: NATASHA
D: Okay...
C: RHODEY
D: Federalés found a room full of bodies outside Juarez. Cartel guys. Guns still in their pants.
C: NATASHA
D: Could be a rival hit-
C: RHODEY
D: But it wasn’t. Same MO as Marseille. And Kiev. 21
E: MORE
C: RHODEY
D: It’s definitely Barton.
E: CONT'D beat
N: She nods, grim, reluctantly accepting.
C: RHODEY
D: What he’s done here...what he’s been doing...I got to tell you, part of me doesn’t want to find him.
E: CONT'D
N: Natasha just stares a long beat.
C: NATASHA
D: Find out where’s he going next.
N: Rhodey nods, signing off. Natasha sits there, THEN CRUMPLES. After a long beat...
C: STEVE
D: I’d offer to cook you dinner but you seem sad enough already.
E: O.S.
N: Natasha turns to see STEVE in the doorway.
C: NATASHA
D: Come by to do your laundry?
C: STEVE
D: And see a friend.
C: NATASHA
D: Your friend’s fine.
C: STEVE
D: She leave the house today?
C: NATASHA
D: Nothing out there I particularly want to see.
C: STEVE
D: I spotted a pod of whales coming over the bridge.
C: NATASHA
D: In the Hudson.
E: dubious
C: STEVE
D: Fewer ships, cleaner water. Just saying, there’s still a world out there. 22
C: NATASHA
D: If you’re about to tell me to look on the bright side, I’m about to hit you with a peanut butter sandwich.
N: Steve relents, LETTING DOWN HIS FACADE.
C: STEVE
D: Sorry. Force of habit.
C: NATASHA
D: I don’t know how you do it.
N: Steve bites into the uneaten half of her sandwich.
C: STEVE
D: I guess I don’t know how not to.
C: NATASHA
D: Me, neither.
N: After a long moment, Steve looks up at her, honest.
C: STEVE
D: I keep telling them, move on. Grow past it. And some of them actually do. But not us.
C: NATASHA
D: If I move on, who does this?
C: STEVE
D: Maybe it doesn’t need to be done.
N: Natasha takes that in. Steve is thinking of giving up. She looks around at Avengers Compound.
C: NATASHA
D: I used to have nothing. Then I got this. This job, this family. And I was better because of it.
N: She chokes slightly, collecting herself.
C: NATASHA
D: And even though they’re gone, I’m still trying to be...better.
E: CONT'D
C: STEVE
D: I think we both need to get a life.
C: NATASHA
D: You first. 23
N: They stare at each other a long, melancholy moment. THEN, WE HEAR A PING. NATASHA SWIPES TO A CCTV DISPLAY: SCOTT LANG’S FACE FILLS A SCREEN, LUIS’ VAN BEHIND HIM.
C: SCOTT LANG
D: Hello? Is anyone home? This is, uh, Scott Lang? We met a few years ago. At the airport?
E: ON SCREEN
C: STEVE
D: This an old message?
C: NATASHA
D: It’s the front gate.
E: stunned
S: INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, WORKSHOP - NIGHT
N: SCOTT paces, mumbling to himself.
C: STEVE
D: Scott, are you okay?
E: O.S.
C: SCOTT LANG
D: What? Yes.
N: He turns to STEVE and NATASHA.
C: SCOTT LANG
D: Have either of you guys ever studied quantum physics?
E: CONT'D
C: NATASHA
D: Only to make conversation.
N: Steve glances at her. She shrugs.
C: SCOTT LANG
D: Well, five years ago, just before this Thanos guy...I went into a place called the Quantum Realm. It’s like its own microscopic universe. You can only get there if you’re incredibly small. Hope, she’s my...she was supposed to pull me out. But then Thanos happened. And I was stuck in there.
C: NATASHA
D: I’m sorry. It must’ve been a long five years. 24
C: SCOTT LANG
D: Okay, but that’s the thing. It wasn’t. For me, it was only five hours. The rules in the Quantum Realm aren’t like out here. They’re completely unpredictable. Is anybody gonna eat that sandwich?
E: getting excited
C: STEVE
D: Scott, what are you talking about?
C: SCOTT LANG
D: Time works differently in the Quantum Realm.
N: Steve and Natasha share a look.
C: SCOTT LANG
D: Problem is, right now, it’s chaos, there’s no way to navigate it. But what if we could figure out a way to enter the Quantum Realm at a certain point in time...and come out in another. Like, before Thanos-
E: CONT'D
C: STEVE
D: Wait...wait. Scott. Are you talking about a time machine?
C: SCOTT LANG
D: No, not a machine. More like a... Yeah, like a time machine. I know it sounds crazy...
E: searches, then gives up
C: NATASHA
D: Scott, I get emails from a raccoon. Nothing’s crazy anymore.
C: SCOTT LANG
D: So, who do we talk to about this?
S: EXT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, UPSTATE NEW YORK - DAY
N: LLAMAS and FARM ANIMALS GRAZE A RUSTIC-TECH ECO-COMPOUND.
S: EXT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, WOODS - DAY
N: TONY approaches A WOODED GLADE near the house.
C: TONY
D: Morgan H. Stark. Chow time. Want some lunch?
N: Silence. Then MORGAN STARK (4) steps out of her play tent, wearing A PURPLE-BLUE IRON MAN HELMET (RESCUE).
C: MORGAN STARK
D: Define lunch or be disintegrated.
C: TONY
D: You should not be wearing that. It’s part of a special anniversary gift I made for Mom. You thinking about lunch?
N: Tony gently takes the helmet off, revealing A YOUNG GIRL.
C: TONY
D: Where’d you find this?
E: CONT'D
C: MORGAN STARK
D: Garage.
N: Tony picks her up, walking toward the house.
C: TONY
D: You like going in the garage? So does Daddy. It’s all right. Mommy never wears what I buy her.
T: TIME CUT:
N: Tony and Morgan exit the woods. Suddenly, Tony stops. In the driveway, STEVE ROGERS stares at him. NATASHA AND SCOTT GET OUT OF THE CAR BEHIND HIM.
S: EXT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, PORCH - DAY
N: STEVE, SCOTT, and NATASHA sit with TONY.
C: TONY
D: I just want to thank you folks for dropping by. It’s not every day one gets to contemplate biting it on an inter-dimensional timescape.
C: NATASHA
D: You’ve got some objections to the plan. 26
C: TONY
D: So you’re calling it a plan. To me, it sounds like an exotic suicide method. Not to mention, it’s impossible.
C: SCOTT LANG
D: We know what it sounds like.
C: STEVE
D: Tony, after what you’ve seen, is anything really impossible?
C: TONY
D: Quantum fluctuation kinda messes with the Planck Scale, which then triggers the Deutsch Proposition, can we agree on that? Chai? In layman’s terms, it means you can cancel your Netflix subscription because you’re not coming home.
E: offering more tea back on message
C: SCOTT LANG
D: I did.
C: TONY
D: Which was a billion-to-one cosmic fluke. Now you want to pull a- What are you calling it?
C: SCOTT LANG
D: A time heist.
C: TONY
D: Oh, of course, a time heist, why didn’t we think of this before? Right, because it’s a pipe dream. Who are you again?
C: SCOTT LANG
D: Still Scott...
C: STEVE
D: Tony, the Stones exist in the past. We could get them and bring them here.
C: NATASHA
D: We can snap our own fingers. We can bring everybody back. 27
C: TONY
D: Or screw it up worse than he already has.
C: STEVE
D: I don’t believe we would.
N: Tony stares at Steve, a lot of water under the bridge.
C: TONY
D: Gotta say it. Sometimes I’ve missed that giddy optimism. Sadly, all your high hopes won’t help me if there’s no logical, tangible way for me to safely execute said “time heist.” I believe the most likely outcome would be our collective demise.
C: SCOTT LANG
D: Not if we strictly follow the rules of time travel. No talking to our past selves. No betting on sporting events-
C: TONY
D: Stop, Scott. Stop. Are you telling me that your plan to save the universe is more than loosely based on Back to the Future?
C: SCOTT LANG
D: No...
E: meaning “yes”
C: TONY
D: Good. Because that would be horseshit. Scientifically speaking, your brother’s picture doesn’t disappear just ‘cause you went to the dance with your mom. That’s not how quantum physics works.
C: NATASHA
D: We have to take a stand.
C: TONY
D: We did stand. And yet here we are.
C: SCOTT LANG
D: Look, Stark- Can I call you Tony? 28
C: TONY
D: Please don’t-
C: SCOTT LANG
D: Tony-
C: TONY
D: Fine.
C: SCOTT LANG
D: I get that you’ve got a lot on the line, here. You’ve got a wife. A daughter. But I lost someone very important - a lot of us did - and now we have a chance to save her, and everyone else, and you won’t even-
C: TONY
D: No, Scott. I won’t. Even.
N: Suddenly, MORGAN walks onto the porch.
C: MORGAN STARK
D: Mommy told me to come save you.
N: Tony takes Morgan into his arms and heads inside.
C: TONY
D: Good job. I’m saved. I wish you were coming here to ask me something else. I’m honestly happy to see you. If you want to stay-
E: to Steve
N: Steve tries one last time.
C: STEVE
D: Tony, I get it. And I’m happy for you. I am. But this is a second chance.
C: TONY
D: Yeah, well, I got my second chance right here. I can’t roll the dice on it. The table is set for six. If you don’t talk shop, you’re welcome to stay for lunch.
N: He exits.
S: EXT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND - DAY
N: Steve, Natasha, and Scott walk toward the car.
C: NATASHA
D: He’s scared.
C: STEVE
D: He’s not wrong.
C: SCOTT LANG
D: What are we gonna do? We need him. You want to stop?
C: STEVE
D: No. I want to do it right. We’re going to need a really big brain.
E: beat
C: SCOTT LANG
D: Bigger than his?
S: EXT. DINER - NIGHT
N: ONLOOKERS crowd a diner window, trying to peek inside.
C: SCOTT LANG
D: I’m confused.
E: O.S.
S: INT. DINER - NIGHT
N: SMART HULK ROLLS UP A PIZZA AND EATS IT LIKE A BURRITO. SCOTT, STEVE, AND NATASHA SIT ACROSS FROM HIM.
C: SMART HULK
D: These are confusing times.
C: SCOTT LANG
D: No, that’s not what I’m-
C: SMART HULK
D: I’m kidding, I get it. It’s crazy. I wear shirts now!
C: SCOTT LANG
D: But why?
C: SMART HULK
D: Five years ago, we got our asses kicked, right? 30
N: Smart Hulk eats a stack of pancakes in two bites.
C: STEVE
D: He’s heard.
C: SMART HULK
D: It was worse for me. Because I lost twice. First Hulk lost. Then Banner lost. Then we all lost.
C: NATASHA
D: No one blamed you, Bruce.
C: SMART HULK
D: I did- I feel like I’m the only one eating. Here, try some.
N: He holds out a pizza. They decline. He shrugs.
C: SMART HULK
D: Thing is, I kept thinking, it didn’t have to be that way. That the best of Banner and best of Hulk, if they’d worked together, maybe they could’ve stopped Thanos.
E: CONT'D
C: SCOTT LANG
D: Okay. But how did...this happen?
C: SMART HULK
D: For years I treated the Hulk like a disease, something to get rid of. But when I started treating him like the cure...
N: Smart Hulk MESHES HIS FINGERS together.
C: SMART HULK
D: Eighteen months in the Gamma Lab. I put the brains and the brawn together. And now look at me. Best of both worlds.
E: CONT'D
N: TWO KIDS amble up to the booth.
C: KID
D: Mr. Hulk? Can we get a picture?
C: SMART HULK
D: 100%, little lady.
N: The kid hands a phone to Steve. SMART HULK makes a duck face as Steve sheepishly snaps the pic, handing the phone back.
C: SMART HULK
D: Thanks, pal. Hulk out!
E: CONT'D to the fan
C: STEVE
D: So, Bruce, about what we said-
C: SMART HULK
D: The time travel do-over? I don’t know, that’s kind of outside my field of expertise...
N: Natasha nods at his Smart Hulk-ness, history between them.
C: NATASHA
D: You pulled this off. I remember a time that was impossible, too.
N: He considers, then finally relents, pulling out his phone.
C: SMART HULK
D: I’m supposed to be on Oprah next week, but I guess I could move things around.
S: INT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, KITCHEN - NIGHT
N: TONY STARK DOES DISHES. He rinses with the sprayer. It goes everywhere. He wipes down the counter, including... A PICTURE OF PETER PARKER. He stares.
S: INT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, SIDE PORCH - NIGHT
N: Tony builds HOLO MODELS: Penrose diagrams, wormholes. He studies a STAR-SHAPED CAPACITOR, intrigued.
C: TONY
D: Friday, you up?
C: FRIDAY
D: Yes, sir.
C: TONY
D: I’ve had a mild inspiration, like to see if it checks out. I would like to run one last sim before we pack it in for the night. This time, in the shape of a Mobius Strip, inverted. 32
C: FRIDAY
D: Processing.
N: The model forms.
C: TONY
D: All right, give me the eigenvalue of that particle, factoring in spectral decomp. Run it. That’ll take a second. And don’t worry if it doesn’t pan out, I’m just kind of...
N: THE CAPACITOR GLOWS. A HOLO-MAN DRIFTS INTO A CIRCULAR WORMHOLE, LOOPING...RETURNING TO THE PLACE IT FIRST LEFT.
C: FRIDAY
D: Model rendered.
C: TONY
D: Shit.
E: in awe
C: MORGAN STARK
D: Shit.
E: O.S.
N: Tony turns to see HIS DAUGHTER in the doorway.
C: TONY
D: What are you doing up?
C: MORGAN STARK
D: Shit.
C: TONY
D: First of all, that’s a Mommy word, she coined it.
C: MORGAN STARK
D: Why are you up?
C: TONY
D: I just had something on my mind.
C: MORGAN STARK
D: Was it juice pops?
C: TONY
D: Correct. Great minds think alike. What kind do you want? 33
S: INT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, MORGAN’S ROOM - NIGHT
N: Morgan eats A JUICE POP in bed. Tony watches.
C: TONY
D: You done? Now you are.
E: finishing her popsicle
C: MORGAN STARK
D: Tell me a story.
C: TONY
D: Once upon a time, Maguna went to bed. The end.
C: MORGAN STARK
D: That was a bad story.
N: He runs his hand over her hair.
C: TONY
D: Love you tons.
C: MORGAN STARK
D: Love you three thousand.
C: TONY
D: Wow, that’s a lot.
N: Tony turns out the light, exits.
S: INT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
N: PHOTOS crowd a side table: Pepper, Morgan, Tony. Even one of HOWARD STARK, PEGGY CARTER & HANK PYM UNDER A SHIELD SYMBOL. Find...PEPPER, curled up on the couch reading. Then...
C: TONY
D: Out like a light. Don’t know how much she loves you but she loves me three thousand.
E: O.S.
C: PEPPER POTTS
D: That’s up there.
C: TONY
D: What’re you reading?
C: PEPPER POTTS A book about composting-
D: 34
C: TONY
D: I think I solved it.
N: Pepper looks up.
C: PEPPER POTTS
D: Just so we’re both talking about the same thing-
C: TONY
D: Time travel.
C: PEPPER POTTS
D: That’s amazing.
C: TONY
D: Yeah.
C: PEPPER POTTS
D: And terrifying.
C: TONY
D: To say the least.
N: He sits beside her. She stares, SHARING IN HIS DILEMMA.
C: PEPPER POTTS
D: We got really lucky-
C: TONY
D: I know-
C: PEPPER POTTS
D: Not everybody did.
C: TONY
D: I can’t help everybody.
C: PEPPER POTTS
D: Except, it sort of seems like you can.
C: TONY
D: Not if I stopped right here.
C: PEPPER POTTS
D: Tony, trying to get you to stop is one of the few failures of my life.
C: TONY
D: I could just lock the lab, put it in a trunk, sink it to the bottom of the lake, and go to bed. 35
C: PEPPER POTTS
D: But could you rest?
S: INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAY
N: SCOTT WAITS IN HIS ANT-MAN 2 QUANTUM SUIT IN FRONT OF THE OPEN VAN DOORS.
C: SCOTT LANG
D: You’re sure these modifications are safe?
N: He looks over to...SMART HULK, WEARING READING GLASSES, MAKING ADJUSTMENTS TO A NEW CONTROL PANEL.
C: SMART HULK
D: I reran my calculations three times-
C: SCOTT LANG
D: Because the guy who invented this thing is pretty much a genius-
C: SMART HULK
D: I have seven PhD’s, an MD, the Hans Bethe Award for Physics, and I’m personal friends with Bill Nye the Science Guy. We’re good.
C: SCOTT LANG
D: Yeah. And you look like that on purpose.
N: STEVE and NATASHA enter from outside.
C: STEVE
D: Breakers are set, emergency generator’s on stand-by.
C: SMART HULK
D: Good. If we blow the grid, I don’t want to lose Tiny back in the ‘50’s.
C: SCOTT LANG
D: Excuse me?
C: NATASHA
D: He was kidding.
C: SMART HULK I was kidding.
D: 36
C: NATASHA
D: You were kidding, right?
E: to Hulk
C: SMART HULK
D: Honestly, I have no idea. We’re attempting time travel. Either it’s all a joke, or none of it is. We’re good! Helmet on.
E: loudly to Scott
N: Scott puts on his helmet, slightly dubious.
C: SMART HULK
D: Okay. I’m going to send you back one week, give you an hour to look around, then bring you back in ten seconds. Make sense?
E: CONT'D
C: SCOTT LANG
D: Perfectly not confusing.
C: STEVE
D: Good luck, Scott. You’ve got this.
C: SCOTT LANG
D: Yes, I do, Captain America. Yes, I-
E: inspired
N: SMART HULK PULLS A LEVER. SCOTT SHRINKS TO NOTHING.
C: SMART HULK
D: Counting down from three, two, one...
N: SUDDENLY SCOTT REAPPEARS...BUT HE’S 12-YEARS-OLD.
C: SCOTT LANG
D: Uh, guys? This doesn’t feel right.
C: NATASHA
D: Is that Scott?
C: SMART HULK
D: Probably...?
N: He scrambles, hitting buttons. SCOTT SHRINKS TO NOTHING.
C: STEVE
D: Get him back!
N: Smart Hulk flips a switch. SCOTT REAPPEARS...AT AGE 93.
C: SCOTT LANG
D: Oh, my back!
C: NATASHA
D: Bruce! Get it under control. What the hell is going on?
C: SMART HULK
D: I got it, I know exactly what’s going on. Pretty much.
N: SCOTT SHRINKS TO NOTHING AGAIN. HULK TYPES FRANTICALLY with A PENCIL, fingers too big for the keys. 2-YEAR OLD SCOTT APPEARS.
C: NATASHA
D: Oh, my God.
C: STEVE
D: It’s a baby.
C: SMART HULK
D: It’s Scott.
C: STEVE
D: As a baby!
N: Smart Hulk hits a button. Baby Scott disappears.
C: SMART HULK
D: When I tell you, kill the power! Now!
E: throwing a switch
N: NATASHA KILLS THE POWER. Normal Scott stumbles off the pad.
C: SCOTT LANG
D: Somebody peed my pants. I don’t know if it was baby-me or old-me. Or just me-me.
S: EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAY
N: Steve leans on the wall, discouraged. Then he hears AN ENGINE ROAR. AN AUDI races up the drive. It stops, the window rolling down to reveal...TONY.
C: TONY
D: Why the long face? Wild guess, he turned into a baby? 38
C: STEVE
D: Among other things.
C: TONY
D: EPR Paradox. Instead of pushing Lang through time, you were pushing time through Lang. It’s dangerous. I probably should’ve cautioned you against it.
E: getting out of the car
C: STEVE
D: You did.
C: TONY
D: Thank god, I’m here. Regardless, I fixed it.
N: He holds up...HIS STAR-SHAPED CAPACITOR.
C: TONY
D: That is a fully-functioning, time- space GPS. I just want peace. Resentment is corrosive. I hate it.
E: CONT'D
C: STEVE
D: Me, too.
N: Something eases between them, for the first time in years.
C: TONY
D: We’ve got a shot at the Stones. I just need you to know my priorities. Bring back everyone we lost, hopefully. Keep what I found, definitely. And, let’s not die trying.
N: Steve looks at Tony. Finally, he offers his hand.
C: STEVE
D: Sounds like a deal.
N: They shake. This is a long time coming. Finally...
C: TONY
D: But wait, there’s more. Act now, and it comes with a bonus offer.
N: Tony pops the trunk. Steve stares, moved, at...HIS SHIELD.
C: STEVE Tony, I don’t know-
D: 39
C: TONY
D: What’s to know? He made it for you. Plus, I gotta get it out of the garage before Morgan takes it sledding.
N: Steve finally picks up the shield, SLIDING IT ONTO HIS ARM.
C: STEVE
D: Thank you, Tony.
N: Tony chokes up, then covers by slamming the trunk.
C: TONY
D: Just don’t flaunt it. I didn’t bring enough for the whole team. We are getting the whole team, right?
C: STEVE
D: We’re trying.
S: EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAY
N: SCOTT sits on a bench, eating a hardshell taco. THEN A MASSIVE EXHAUST WIND BLASTS HIM, blowing his taco away. THE BENATAR lands outside AVENGERS COMPOUND. NEBULA AND ROCKET EMERGE. Rocket waits at the end of the gangway.
C: ROCKET
D: Hey, Humie. Where’s Big Green?
C: SCOTT LANG
D: Um, kitchen, I think.
N: Scott tries a smile at Nebula. She just hits her COM:
C: NEBULA
D: Rhodey, careful on re-entry. There’s an idiot in the landing zone.
E: INTO COM
N: She goes in. THEN, WHAM, WAR MACHINE LANDS, STARTLING SCOTT.
C: SCOTT LANG
D: Oh, my God!
C: RHODEY
D: What’s up, Regular-Sized Man?
N: Rhodey goes inside as SMART HULK walks out, carrying an overnight bag. He hands Scott some tacos.
C: ROCKET
D: Finally. I ain’t got all day.
C: SMART HULK
D: I call shotgun!
N: As he walks up the Benatar’s gangway, PRE-LAP A METALLIC SCRAPING SOUND.
S: EXT. NEW ASGARD - DAY
N: The scraping goes on as we see...A NORWEGIAN FISHING VILLAGE. Tilt to a sign: “NEW ASGARD,” in English and ASGARDIAN RUNES. A PICK-UP passes, scraping the pavement: SMART HULK AND ROCKET SIT IN BACK, WEIGHING DOWN THE TRUCK.
S: EXT. NEW ASGARD, VILLAGE - DAY
N: SMART HULK AND ROCKET WALK THROUGH TOWN. ASGARDIANS IN EARTHLY CLOTHES EYE THEM WITH SUSPICION.
C: ROCKET
D: What the heck are they looking at?
C: SMART HULK
D: I’m kind of famous...
C: ROCKET
D: Yeah, I’m sure that’s it. Kind of a step down from golden palaces and magic hammers...
C: SMART HULK
D: They lost Asgard, then half their people. Maybe they’re just happy to have a home.
C: VALKYRIE
D: You shouldn’t have come.
E: O.S.
N: VALKYRIE approaches from the pier. Smart Hulk GRINS.
C: SMART HULK
D: Hey, Valkyrie! Great to see you!
N: He goes for a hug...VAL DOESN’T. She studies the new him.
C: VALKYRIE
D: Uh huh. I liked you better either of the other ways. 41
C: SMART HULK
D: This is Rocket.
C: ROCKET
D: Hey.
C: VALKYRIE
D: Hey. He won’t see you.
E: to both
C: SMART HULK
D: We didn’t say we were here to see-
C: VALKYRIE
D: Great, then you can hose out the gut buckets-
C: ROCKET
D: We’re definitely here to see him.
C: VALKYRIE
D: He can’t give you what you need.
C: SMART HULK
D: It’s that bad?
C: VALKYRIE
D: We only see him once a month. When he comes in for “supplies.”
N: She nods to A DOZEN BEER KEGS STACKED OUTSIDE A PUB.
S: EXT. NEW ASGARD, CABIN - DAY
N: Smart Hulk and Rocket knock on the door of A CABIN. Nothing.
S: INT. NEW ASGARD, CABIN - DAY
N: SMART HULK opens the door. PIZZA BOXES and LIQUOR BOTTLES litter the floor. Rocket recoils.
C: ROCKET
D: Something died in here.
C: SMART HULK
D: Hello...? Thor...?
C: THOR
D: Are you here about the cable?
E: O.S.
N: We hear a HEAVY SHUFFLING as someone approaches.
C: THOR
D: Cinemax went out two days ago, and the sports are all...fuzzy...
E: CONT'D
N: THOR enters, CONFUSED, A LITTLE DRUNK, SHIRTLESS...AND TREMENDOUSLY FAT. Rocket and Hulk stare.
C: SMART HULK
D: Thor?
C: THOR
D: BROS! Bring it in!
N: Thor hugs Smart Hulk. He turns to Rocket, who steps back.
C: ROCKET
D: Yeah, I’m good.
C: THOR
D: Hulk, you know my boys, Korg and Miek, right?
N: KORG and MIEK sit on the couch, playing Playstation 4.
C: KORG
D: Beer’s in the bucket. Feel free to log on to the WiFi.
C: SMART HULK
D: Hey, guys. Long time no-
C: KORG
D: Thor! This kid on the TV just called me a dickhead!
C: THOR
D: Noobmaster again?
C: KORG
D: NoobMaster69 called me a dickhead-
N: Thor snatches KORG’S HEADSET and hisses into the mic.
C: THOR
D: Noobmaster, this is Thor, again. God of Thunder. This is your last warning. Log off this game or I will come to your basement, rip off your arms and shove them up your butt. Right, who wants a drink? 43
E: handing the headset back
N: SMART HULK AND ROCKET JUST STARE. Thor pulls a beer from the fridge, and whacks the cap against STORMBREAKER.
C: SMART HULK
D: Hey, buddy, are you all right?
C: THOR
D: Don’t I look all right?
C: ROCKET
D: You look like melted ice cream-
E: under his breath
C: THOR
D: So, what’s up? Just here for a hang?
C: SMART HULK
D: We need your help. There’s a chance we can fix everything.
C: THOR
D: Like the cable? It’s driving me bananas.
C: SMART HULK
D: Like Thanos.
N: THOR GRABS HULK’S SHIRT, INTENSE. KORG RISES FROM THE COUCH.
C: THOR
D: Don’t say that name.
C: KORG
D: Yeah, we don’t say that name in here.
N: Smart Hulk looks down at THOR’S HAND STILL ON HIS SHIRT.
C: SMART HULK
D: Please take your hand off me.
N: Thor looks into Hulk’s eyes...and gently removes his hand.
C: SMART HULK
D: Now, I know the thought of...that guy might scare you-
E: CONT'D
C: THOR
D: Scared? Why would I be scared of that guy? I’m the one who killed that guy, remember? Anyone else here kill that guy? 44
E: looking around MORE
C: THOR
D: Didn’t think so. Korg, tell everyone who chopped Thanos’ head off.
E: CONT'D
C: KORG
D: Stormbreaker?
N: Thor uncaps a whiskey bottle. BLAM, IT SHATTERS IN HIS HAND. Reveal...ROCKET, BLASTER SMOKING.
C: THOR
D: Not. Cool. Man.
C: ROCKET
D: Don’t. Care. Dude.
C: SMART HULK
D: Look, I get it. You’re in a rough patch. I’ve been there. But you know who helped me out of it?
C: THOR
D: Was it Natasha?
C: SMART HULK
D: It was you. You helped me. And I need you to help me again.
C: THOR
D: Ask the Asgardians down there how much “my help” is worth.
C: ROCKET
D: At least they’re alive-
C: THOR
D: They were gods! Now they’re fisherpeople! The ones that are left, anyway.
E: sagging into a chair
C: SMART HULK
D: That’s the thing. I think we can bring them back.
N: Thor’s tempted, but shakes his head.
C: THOR
D: Stop. Stop. I know you think I’m down here, wallowing in my own self- pity, waiting to be rescued. But I’m fine. I’m happy. Whatever it is you’re offering, don’t care. Couldn’t care less. 45
N: Hulk and Rocket stare at Thor.
C: SMART HULK
D: Come on, pal. We need you.
N: He still can’t meet their gaze. Finally...
C: ROCKET
D: There’s beer in the ship.
C: THOR
D: What kind?
E: beat
S: EXT. TOKYO - NIGHT
N: A KARAOKE BAR LIES IN RUINS AS A TINNY POP SONG PLAYS. BLOOD POOLS BENEATH DEAD YAKUZA THUGS, UZIS JUST OUT OF REACH OF THEIR TATTOOED HANDS. TITLE: “TOKYO.” AS WE PULL BACK...THE MUSIC FADES, REPLACED BY A SOFT CRYING. A TERRIFIED HOSTESS DARTS FROM COVER, WIPING AWAY THE CHYRON. KEEP PULLING BACK...PAST A CAR SMASHED THROUGH THE FRONT WINDOW, TATTOOED DRIVER SLUMPED OVER THE WHEEL, GUN IN HAND. WE HEAR RAIN, A REVVING ENGINE, AND THEN GUNFIRE. PULL ONTO THE SIDEWALK, TURNING JUST AS A MOTORCYCLE CRASHES, RIDER TUMBLING PAST US IN A WHITE MOHAWKED HELMET. ANOTHER MOTORCYCLE RACES TOWARD US, BUT... WHFT-WHFT, TWO ARROWS SEND THE RIDER SKIDDING INTO A WALL, TIRES SQUEALING AS THE BIKE SPINS HELPLESSLY ON ITS SIDE. CAMERA TURNS TOWARD AN ALCOVE, WHERE A YAKUZA THUG TUMBLES OFF THE STAIRS AS... A MASKED FIGURE HEADS UP, STOPPING MOMENTARILY TO DRAW HIS TELESCOPING BLADE. BEHIND THE SMOKED GLASS OF SECOND FLOOR WINDOWS, THE FIGURE FIGHTS ANOTHER THUG. THEN... CRASH, THE THUG COMES SMASHING THROUGH THE WINDOW. THUD. WHIP THROUGH THE RAIN TO THE UPPER FLOORS OF THE BUILDING. GUNFIRE FLASHES AS THE FIGHT CONTINUES PAST THREE WINDOWS... SUDDENLY, THE FOURTH WINDOW SHATTERS AS A YAKUZA BOSS, AKIHIKO, LEAPS OVER THE SIDEWALK... LANDING ON THE METAL AWNING OF A NOODLE SHOP. HE ROLLS TO THE WET STREET, LANDING HARD ON HIS ANKLE. THE MYSTERIOUS FIGURE GRACEFULLY LEAPS AFTER HIM, BOUNCING OFF THE AWNING AND DROPPING TO THE STREET BELOW. RACK UP TO GET OUR BEST LOOK YET AT...RONIN. HARD-SET EYES STARE AT AKIHIKO THROUGH A BLACK MASK. THEY BATTLE.
C: AKIHIKO
D: Why are you doing this? We never did anything to you!
E: Japanese, subtitled
C: RONIN
D: You survived. Half the planet didn’t. They got Thanos. You get me.
E: Japanese, subtitled
N: Akihiko attacks. Ronin slashes him across the middle.
C: RONIN
D: You’re done hurting people.
E: CONT'D Japanese, subtitled
N: Akihiko gestures at the bodies in the street.
C: AKIHIKO
D: We hurt people? You’re crazy.
N: Ronin slashes Akihiko’s throat. The man drops to his knees.
C: AKIHIKO
D: Wait! Help me! I’ll give you anything! What do you want?
E: CONT'D
C: RONIN
D: What I want...you can’t give me.
N: Ronin finishes him off. AKIHIKO GOES STILL. SIRENS WAIL. Ronin removes his mask, revealing... CLINT BARTON, haggard. He hears A FOOTFALL. He whirls, katana raised...then stops. His face goes slack as... NATASHA STEPS INTO A POOL OF LIGHT, A LARGE BLACK UMBRELLA KEEPING HER FROM THE RAIN. They stare at each other. Clint hasn’t seen her in years. She hasn’t seen what he’s become.
S: CLINT BARTON
N: You shouldn’t be here.
C: NATASHA
D: Neither should you.
S: CLINT BARTON
N: I’ve got a job to do.
C: NATASHA
D: That what you’re calling this?
N: She moves even closer. He stiffens.
C: NATASHA
D: Killing these people isn’t going to bring your family back. We found something. A chance, maybe...
E: CONT'D beat
S: CLINT BARTON
N: Don’t.
C: NATASHA
D: Don’t what?
S: CLINT BARTON
N: Give me hope.
C: NATASHA
D: I’m just sorry I couldn’t give it sooner.
N: CLINT DISSOLVES, sagging into her arms.
S: INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAY
N: THOR STANDS WITH A BEER IN A COZY, staring at A NEW QUANTUM TUNNEL (2.0), AFFIXED WITH TONY’S CAPACITOR.
C: TONY
D: Out of the way, Lebowski.
E: O.S.
N: Thor shuffles aside as Tony blows past.
C: TONY
D: Hey, Ratchet, you get lost in there?
E: CONT'D
C: ROCKET
D: It’s Rocket, and shut up. You’re only a genius on Earth, pal. 48
E: O.S.
C: TONY
D: And you’re only in there because you have tiny hands.
N: ROCKET, COVERED IN GREASE, WRIGGLES OUT A HATCH.
C: ROCKET
D: Fixed it.
C: TONY
D: Thank you.
C: ROCKET
D: Get used to saying that.
S: INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, WORKSHOP - DAY
N: SMART HULK fits SCOTT with A BRAND NEW TIME SUIT. NEBULA ASSISTS. RHODEY enters the workshop, eyeing the suit.
C: RHODEY
D: Time travel suit, I like it.
N: SMART HULK awkwardly tries to fit a pair of RED TEST TUBES INTO THE TIME SUIT’S BELT.
C: SCOTT LANG
D: Easy, easy. Careful with those.
C: SMART HULK
D: I’m being very careful-
C: SCOTT LANG
D: You’re being very Hulky-
N: Scott takes the tubes from him and inserts them, himself.
C: SCOTT LANG
D: These are Pym Particles. You can’t shrink to the Quantum Realm without them, and since Hank Pym got snapped out of existence, we can’t make any more. I told you. We’ve only got enough for one round trip each, no do-overs.
E: CONT'D
N: Scott gently clicks the tubes into their housing.
C: SCOTT LANG
D: Plus two test runs-
E: CONT'D
N: SUDDENLY, SCOTT SHRINKS INTO NOTHING, THEN GROWS BACK. He takes that in...
C: SCOTT LANG
D: One test run. Okay, maybe I’m not ready.
E: CONT'D embarrassed
S: CLINT BARTON (O.S.)
N: I’m game. They turn to see CLINT leaning in the doorway.
S: CLINT BARTON (CONT'D)
N: I’ll do it.
T: TIME CUT:
N: NOW, CLINT WEARS THE TIME SUIT. Scott looks on, sulky. SMART HULK, RHODEY, and NEBULA attach the Pym housing.
C: SMART HULK
D: Okay, Clint, you might feel a little disoriented when you chronoshift-
C: RHODEY
D: Hang on, I’ve got to ask, if we can do this, why don’t we just go find baby Thanos and, you know...
N: Rhodey makes a STRANGLING GESTURE.
C: SMART HULK
D: Uh, one, because that’s horrible. And, two, killing baby Thanos doesn’t kill adult Thanos. Time doesn’t work like that. You can’t change the future by changing the past.
C: SCOTT LANG
D: Sure, we can. We take the stones before Thanos gets them, then he doesn’t have them. Problem solved.
C: NEBULA
D: That’s not how it works.
S: CLINT BARTON
N: I don’t know. That is kind of what I’ve heard-
C: SMART HULK
D: Heard from who? 50
C: RHODEY
D: Star Trek. Terminator. Bill and Ted’s Excellent-
C: SMART HULK
D: WHY DOES EVERYONE THINK THIS? THAT’S NOT TRUE. IF YOU TRAVEL TO THE PAST, THEN THAT PAST HAS BECOME YOUR PRESENT, AND YOUR FORMER PRESENT HAS BECOME THE PAST, WHICH NOW CAN’T BE CHANGED BY YOUR NEW FUTURE!
C: NEBULA
D: Exactly.
C: RHODEY
D: Excuse me?
N: Scott leans over, whispering:
C: SCOTT LANG
D: Apparently, Back to the Future is bullshit.
S: CLINT BARTON
N: Look, are we doing this or not?
S: INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAY CLINT WAITS ALONE ON THE PLATFORM, WEARING THE TIME SUIT.
N: SMART HULK readies THE QUANTUM CONSOLE as ROCKET, RHODEY, NEBULA, THOR, and STEVE look on.
C: SMART HULK
D: Okay, Clint. Starting in three, two, one...
N: Clint nods over at them, determined. SUDDENLY, HE STRETCHES, SHRINKS, AND VANISHES. WHOOSH.
S: EXT. BARTON HOME, BARN - DAY
N: Through the slats of a barn, we see a tractor. ENERGY
S: FLARES, REVEALING CLINT BARTON IN A TIME SUIT.
N: He walks to the open door, staring at...HIS OLD HOME.
S: EXT./INT. BARTON HOME, FRONT PORCH - DAY
N: Clint climbs the porch. He accidentally kicks...A BASEBALL MITT. Then he hears VOICES. He stares into the house through THE SCREEN DOOR. From the sounds of it, LAURA and THE KIDS are making dinner. HIS DAUGHTER LAUGHS. Clint’s face crumples. Just then...HIS QUANTUM CUFF VIBRATES. A SCREEN COUNTS DOWN: 0:03.
S: CLINT BARTON
N: No. Not yet... (opening the door) LILA!
S: BUT HIS BODY STARTS TO GLOW. 0.01- CLINT VANISHES. THE
N: SCREEN DOOR SLAMS. After a moment, LILA runs in.
C: LILA BARTON
D: Dad?
S: INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAY
N: CLINT APPEARS ON THE PAD, SHAKEN. TONY and NATASHA approach.
C: NATASHA
D: Are you all right? Hey, look at me. You okay?
C: TONY
D: Tell me something good...
N: Clint looks up, tearful. He holds out THE BASEBALL MITT.
S: CLINT BARTON
N: It worked. It worked. Reveal Steve, Smart Hulk, Nebula, Rhodey, Scott, Thor, and Rocket, looking on.
C: ROCKET
D: Holy crap. We’re freaking time travelers.
S: INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, LIVING AREA, DAY 1 - DAY (MOCO)
N: On a HOLO-BOARD: “MIND, SPACE, TIME, POWER, REALITY, SOUL.” Above each word hovers...ITS ARTIFACT: LOKI’S SCEPTER, THE TESSERACT, THE EYE OF AGAMOTTO, THE ORB, THE AETHER CONTAINER, AND A QUESTION MARK.
C: STEVE
D: Okay. Now that we’ve got how, we’re going to need where and when.
N: NEBULA, TONY, RHODEY, SCOTT, SMART HULK, ROCKET, NATASHA, and CLINT look on.
C: STEVE
D: Most folks here have encountered at least one of the six Infinity Stones-
E: CONT'D
C: TONY
D: I think you mean nearly been killed by one of the six Infinity Stones.
C: SCOTT LANG I haven’t.
D: Just...saying.
E: off their looks
C: SMART HULK
D: Regardless, we’ve only got enough Pym Particles for one round trip, each. And the Stones have been in a lot of places throughout history.
C: TONY
D: Our history. Not all of them are going to be a fun drop-in.
S: CLINT BARTON
N: Which means we’ve got to pick our targets.
C: STEVE
D: Exactly. Let’s start with the Aether. Thor, what do we know?
E: he taps “REALITY”
N: Everyone looks toward...THOR, slumped over.
C: NATASHA
D: Is he asleep?
C: RHODEY
D: I’m pretty sure he’s dead.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: THOR sulks, looking at the Aether Container Holo: “REALITY” Locations are listed: “SVARTALFHEIM, KNOWHERE, LONDON.”
C: THOR
D: The Aether’s not a stone, it’s more of an angry sludge. My grandfather hid it from Dark Elves in a rock between dimensions that can only be accessed every 5000 years.
N: HIS ROBOTIC EYE drifts off in the wrong direction. Thor bangs his head, resetting his eye.
C: THOR
D: Or...by Jane. She stuck her hand in a rock. Then the Aether stuck itself inside her. Then I took her to Asgard. We were dating... We’re not anymore.
E: CONT'D depressed
N: Everyone stares.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, LIVING AREA, DAY 2 - DAY (MOCO)

C: ROCKET
D: Quill said he stole the Power Stone from Morag.
N: He paces on top of the table, past SMART HULK EATING A PINT OF “HUNKA HULKA BURNING FUDGE.”
C: SMART HULK
D: That’s a person?
C: ROCKET
D: It’s a planet. Quill was a person.
C: SCOTT LANG
D: Wait, like a planet...in space?
N: Rocket pinches Scott’s cheek.
C: ROCKET
D: Aw, look. It’s like a puppy, all happy and everything. 54
E: MORE

C: NEBULA
D: Thanos found the Soul Stone on Vormir.
C: NATASHA
D: And that is...?

N: That hangs heavily. A moment passes. Then...
C: SCOTT LANG
D: Not it.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, OFFICE - DAY, EARLY
N: Tony, Natasha, and Smart Hulk hash it out.
C: NATASHA
D: So this ‘Time Stone’ guy...what kind of doctor was he?
C: SMART HULK
D: Strange?
C: TONY
D: Cross between ear-nose-and-throat and rabbit-from-hat.
C: SMART HULK
D: Had a nice place in the Village.
C: TONY
D: Yeah. Sullivan Street. 55
C: SMART HULK
D: Bleecker.
C: TONY
D: Sullivan and Bleecker. They’re cross streets.
C: NATASHA
D: Wait, he lived in New York? Guys, pick the right year and there were three stones in New York.
C: SMART HULK
D: Shut the front door...
E: beat
S: INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, LIVING AREA, DAY 3 - DAY
N: STEVE blocks our view.
C: STEVE
D: Okay, we have a plan. Six stones, three teams, one shot.
N: He steps away, revealing the board... EVERYONE EYES THE TANGLE OF LINES CONNECTING SIX STONES TO FOUR LOCATIONS TO TWO YEARS TO TEN HEROES. IT’S INSANE.
S: INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAWN
N: DAWN RISES OUTSIDE HUGE WINDOWS. OUR HEROES MARCH PAST IN THEIR TIME SUITS.
C: STEVE
D: Five years ago, we lost. All of us.
E: O.S.
S: INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAY
N: THE HEROES GATHER ON THE QUANTUM PLATFORM.
C: STEVE

E: beat
N: Steve takes in the groupings of heroes: RHODEY & NEBULA, NAT & CLINT, THOR & ROCKET, TONY & SCOTT.
C: STEVE
D: You have your teams and you have assignments. Get your stone, and get back here. One round trip each. No mistakes. No do-overs.
E: CONT'D
N: He grips HIS SHIELD.
C: STEVE
D: Most of us are going back to places we know. That doesn’t mean we know what to expect. Be careful. Look out for each other. Improvise, if you have to. This is the fight of our lives. And we’re going to win. Whatever it takes.
E: CONT'D looking around beat
N: The platform stays quiet. Rocket WHISPERS to Scott:
C: ROCKET
D: He’s pretty good at that...
N: Scott nods enthusiastically.
C: TONY
D: All right, you heard the man. Stroke those keys, Jolly Green.
E: to Smart Hulk
N: Smart Hulk taps in commands with HIS PENCIL. LIGHTS ILLUMINATE EACH PAD.
C: SMART HULK
D: Tracking beacons engaged.
N: Clint checks his pocket: A SHRUNKEN BENATAR sits inside.
C: ROCKET
D: You promise to bring that thing back in one piece?
S: CLINT BARTON
N: Yeah, sure thing. I’ll do my best.
C: ROCKET
D: That’s pretty lame, as far as promises go.
N: SMART HULK STEPS ONTO THE PLATFORM, COMPLETING THE LINEUP. THE PLATFORM BEGINS TO VIBRATE. NATASHA LOOKS AROUND.
C: NATASHA
D: See you in a minute.
C: SMART HULK
D: Actually, it’ll be closer to seven or eight microseconds, give or-
N: SUDDENLY, THEY STRETCH AND VANISH, SHRINKING AWAY. WHOOSH. THE QUANTUM CONSOLE STOPS VIBRATING. HULK’S PENCIL SLOWLY ROLLS TOWARD THE EDGE...AND DROPS OFF-
S: EXT. NEW YORK CITY - DAY (AVENGERS 1)

N: FLASH! STEVE, SMART HULK, TONY, and SCOTT arrive at the mouth of an alley, just out of sight.
C: TONY
D: Okay, Park Avenue’s that way. Let’s huddle up. Suits off.
N: They all touch their cuffs, RETRACTING THEIR TIME SUITS.
C: STEVE
D: We’ve all got our assignments. Two stones uptown, one stone down. Stay low, keep an eye on time-
N: Just then, A1 HULK BOUNDS DOWN THE STREET SMASHING THINGS.
C: STEVE
D: And Bruce? Maybe smash a few things along the way. For appearances.
E: CONT'D
C: SMART HULK
D: All right, but I have to say, it seems gratuitous.
E: taking off his shirt
N: He half-heartedly smashes a few cars.
C: SMART HULK
D: Grrr...grrr...
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. SANCTUM SANCTORUM, ROOF - DAY (AVENGERS 1)
N: THE BATTLE OF NEW YORK RAGES. CHITAURI CHARIOTS ZOOM OVER THE VILLAGE. SUDDENLY...BOOM, THE CHARIOTS EXPLODE. ON ONE SIDE OF THE SANCTUM ROOF, A TINY, HOODED FIGURE hurls jagged mandalas into the sky. ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOF...SMART HULK LANDS. He heads for a door, but...
C: ANCIENT ONE
D: I’d be careful going that way...
E: O.S.
N: He turns to find...THE ANCIENT ONE STARING AT HIM.
C: ANCIENT ONE
D: We just had the floors waxed.
E: CONT'D
N: SMART HULK THINKS, THEN GROWLS, TRYING TO INTIMIDATE HER.
C: SMART HULK
D: Hulk...does what...Hulk want?
C: ANCIENT ONE
D: Yes, I suppose that would be the case-
N: JUST THEN, ON THE ROOF OPPOSITE, A1 HULK TACKLES A CHITAURI CHARIOT, RIPPING IT IN HALF. HE ROARS, LEAPING AWAY. Smart Hulk blinks, sheepish. The Ancient One looks at him.
C: ANCIENT ONE
D: Care to explain?
E: CONT'D
C: SMART HULK
D: I’m looking for Dr. Strange.
C: ANCIENT ONE
D: You’re about five years too early. Stephen Strange is currently performing surgery, 20 blocks that way. What do you want with him?
N: He finally notices THE EYE OF AGAMOTTO HANGING FROM HER NECK.
C: SMART HULK
D: Well, that, actually. 59
C: ANCIENT ONE
D: Ah. I’m afraid not.
C: SMART HULK
D: I’m seriously sorry but...I wasn’t asking.
N: Smart Hulk cracks his knuckles and moves in. She smiles.
C: ANCIENT ONE
D: You don’t want to do this.
C: SMART HULK
D: You’re right, I don’t. But I need that stone, and I don’t have a lot of time to debate it-
N: He reaches for it. THE ANCIENT ONE SLAMS HER PALM INTO HIS CHEST AND BLASTS BRUCE BANNER RIGHT OUT OF SMART HULK. “ASTRAL BANNER” hangs in the air, staring at his frozen Smart Hulk body. He looks at his human hands, overwhelmed.
C: ASTRAL BANNER
D: No, no, no-
N: She topples Smart Hulk’s body with one finger. Whump.
C: ANCIENT ONE
D: Now. Let’s start over, shall we?

E: O.S.
C: MAIDEN
D: Pants?
E: O.S.
C: JANE FOSTER
D: It’s okay. Nevermind.
E: O.S.
N: Pull back to...ROCKET AND THOR, WATCHING from behind a crypt. Rocket holds a syringe-like EXTRACTION DEVICE.
C: THOR
D: That’s Jane.
C: ROCKET
D: Okay, here’s the deal. You’re going to charm her, and I’m going to poke her with this thing, extract the Reality Stone, and get gone lickety-split.
N: Thor looks off in the other direction, anxious.
C: THOR
D: Um, I’ll be right back. The wine cellar is just down here. My father used to have this barrel of Aakonian ale. Felt like getting hit in the face with a poleaxe. I’ll see if the scullery has a couple of to-go cups-
N: They hear SOMEONE APPROACHING. Rocket yanks Thor back as...FRIGGA AND HER HANDMAIDENS ENTER THE CORRIDOR.
C: FRIGGA
D: Send Loki some soup. I don’t think he’s eating. And ask our librarians to pull some volumes from the astronomy shelves. He won’t read them, but at least they’ll keep him company.
N: Thor watches Frigga and her coterie disappear down the hall.
C: ROCKET
D: Who’s the fancy broad?
C: THOR
D: My mother. She dies today.
C: ROCKET
D: Oh, jeez.
N: Thor starts to sweat.
C: THOR
D: I can’t do this. This is a bad idea. I can’t do this...
N: Rocket climbs onto a marble monument.
C: ROCKET
D: Come here. 61
N: Thor steps closer. ROCKET SLAPS HIM ACROSS THE FACE.
C: ROCKET
D: You think you’re the only one who’s lost people? What do you think we’re doing here? I lost the only family I ever had. Quill, Groot, Drax, the chick with the antenna. All gone. I’ve lived five meaningless years without them, and every minute has blown Aaskvarian gornads. I get you miss your mom. But she’s gone. Really gone. There are plenty of people who are only kind of gone. And you can help them. So, is it too much to ask that you brush the crumbs out of your beard, make shmoopy talk to Prettypants, and when she’s not looking, suck out the Infinity Stone, and help me get my family back?
E: CONT'D
N: Thor stares at him a long moment. He wipes his tears away.
C: THOR
D: I guess not.
C: ROCKET
D: Good.
C: THOR
D: Thank you. I can do this.

D: Great.
N: As Rocket scurries to Jane’s door, Thor murmurs to himself.

C: NEBULA
D: Let’s take cover. We’re not the only ones in this reality looking for the stones.
C: RHODEY
D: Hey, who are you talking about right now? Who else is looking for the stones?
C: NEBULA
D: My father. My sister. And me.
N: MOVE IN ON RHODEY, CONCERNED.

A GRENADE KNOCKS BAD NEBULA TO HER KNEES. TWO KORBINITE RIFLEMEN BEAR DOWN ON HER. Suddenly, A GREEN BLUR LEAPS IN, SLICING THE RIFLEMEN’S THROATS. THE TWO HUGE SOLDIERS DROP... REVEALING GAMORA looking down at her sister. Beat.
C: GAMORA
D: You’re welcome?
C: BAD NEBULA

N: Off Bad Nebula’s intrigued look...
S: INT. Q-SHIP - DAY

D: Ronan has located the Power Stone. I’m dispatching you to his ship.
C: GAMORA
D: He won’t like it.
N: Thanos wipes the blood from his blade.

N: Thanos finally lays his eyes on her.
C: THANOS
D: No. You won’t.

E: HOLO O.S
N: BAD NEBULA SLUMPS, breaking the projection. Gamora goes to her, trying to prop her up.
C: GAMORA
D: Who was that?
C: BAD NEBULA
D: I...don’t know. My head...splitting...
N: Bad Nebula winces. Gamora looks to Thanos.
C: GAMORA
D: Her synaptic drive was probably damaged in battle-
C: THANOS
D: Sshhh...
N: Thanos looks down at Bad Nebula. He gently lifts her head with his blade. Something’s not right.
C: THANOS
D: Bring her to my ship.

C: A1 NATASHA
D: Careful with that. 68
N: A1 CLINT pours himself A DRINK at Tony’s bar.
S: A1 CLINT BARTON
N: Unless you want your mind erased. And not in the fun way. Sitwell carries the scepter to THE SERVICE ELEVATOR...WHERE A STRIKE TEAM WAITS. BROCK RUMLOW hits “down.”
C: BROCK RUMLOW
D: We promise to be extra careful.
N: Scott stares at Sitwell and Rumlow.
C: SCOTT LANG
D: Who are these guys?
C: TONY
D: SHIELD. Actually, Hydra. But we didn’t know that yet.
C: SCOTT LANG
D: Seriously? ‘Cause it’s kind of obvious they’re bad guys.

E: INTO COM
N: Loki rolls his eyes...AND TRANSFORMS INTO A COPY OF STEVE.
C: LOKI/STEVE
D: “I’m on my way down to coordinate search and rescue.” I mean, really, how do you keep your food down?
N: Thor slaps A MUZZLE on Loki, who REVERTS TO HIS OWN FORM.
C: A1 THOR
D: Yes, that’s much better.
N: He steers his brother into THE MAIN ELEVATOR.
C: A1 THOR
D: You coming, Stark? 69
E: CONT'D
N: Nearby, A1 TONY uses his gauntleted hand to place THE TESSERACT into AN ALUMINUM ATTACHE CASE.
C: A1 TONY
D: One sec, just packing my lunch.
C: TONY
D: All right, you’re up, Little Buddy. There’s our stone
N: A1 Tony crosses to the elevator. Scott takes position, readying himself.
C: SCOTT LANG
D: All right. Flick me.
N: Tony flicks Scott with a finger, sending him sailing into the ATTACHE CASE. TONY leaps out the window, Bleeding Edge armor forming around him as he falls. A1 Tony joins the others in the elevator. Then... A1 HULK steps up to THE ALREADY CROWDED ELEVATOR. Avengers smile awkwardly. There’s no room.
C: A1 HULK
D: Hulk take stairs.

S: EXT. STARK TOWER - DAY

D: Rumlow.
N: The doors close. Everyone rides in silence. Tension mounts.
C: STEVE
D: I got a call from the Secretary’s office. I’m going to be running point on the scepter.
E: CONT'D
N: Behind him, Sitwell and Rumlow exchange a glance.
C: AGENT SITWELL
D: Sir? I don’t understand-
C: STEVE
D: We’ve had word there might be an attempt to steal it.
N: Steve reaches for the scepter, but Rumlow holds tight.
C: BROCK RUMLOW
D: Afraid we can’t allow that, Cap.
C: AGENT SITWELL
D: I’ll have to check with the Director-
E: pulling out his phone

E: CONT'D
N: THEIR EYES GO WIDE.
S: INT. STARK TOWER, 10TH FLOOR - DAY (AVENGERS 1)

S: INT. STARK TOWER, STAIRWELL - DAY (AVENGERS 1)
N: A1 HULK lumbers down the stairs, taking chunks out of corners in the tiny stairwell. He snorts, growing more pissed off.

D: SO MANY STAIRS!
S: INT. STARK TOWER, LOBBY - DAY (AVENGERS 1)
N: A1 TONY carries the TESSERACT CASE through THE LOBBY, followed by A1 THOR and LOKI. SWAT TROOPERS clear a path. ONE TURNS ASIDE, RAISING HIS MASK, REVEALING...OUR TONY.

C: ALEXANDER PIERCE
D: Mind if I ask where you’re going?
C: A1 THOR
D: We were thinking lunch, then Asgard. And you are?
C: A1 TONY
D: Alexander Pierce. He’s the guy behind the guys behind Fury, so don’t mess.
C: ALEXANDER PIERCE
D: My friends call me Mr. Secretary. I have to ask you to turn the prisoner over to me.
E: to Thor
C: A1 THOR
D: Loki will answer to Odin, himself.
C: ALEXANDER PIERCE
D: No, he’ll answer to us. “Odin” can have what’s left. And we’ll need the case back, too. That’s been SHIELD property for over seventy years.
E: to Tony
C: A1 TONY
D: I’m not gonna argue who has authority here but jurisdictionally speaking, we are on Stark property. That is my name on the glass...
C: ALEXANDER PIERCE

D: That doesn’t actually sound minor-
N: Tony sees PIERCE reaching for A1 TONY’S CASE.
C: TONY
D: Window’s closing. Pull my plug.
C: SCOTT LANG
D: Here goes...
N: SCOTT YANKS THE WIRE OUT OF ITS SOCKET. IN THE LOBBY, A1 TONY GRIPS HIS CHEST.
C: ALEXANDER PIERCE
D: Stark?
N: A1 Tony SEIZES, dropping. THE TESSERACT CASE CLATTERS TO THE GROUND. PIERCE and A1 THOR kneel to assist.
C: ALEXANDER PIERCE
D: MEDIC!
E: CONT'D
C: A1 THOR
D: Stark? Somebody get some help! Is it your chest machine?
N: THE LOBBY BUZZES, SHIELD AGENTS RUNNING EVERYWHERE. In the bustle, SCOTT SLIDES OUT OF A1 TONY’S SLEEVE. He SHOVES THE TESSERACT CASE HARD. It SPINS across the floor... RIGHT INTO TONY’S HAND. Tony walks toward a side door.
C: TONY
D: Meet me in the alley. I’m just gonna grab a slice at Famous Ray’s-
E: INTO COM
N: BUT AS TONY PASSES THE STAIRWELL DOOR...HULK BANGS IT OPEN, SMASHING TONY IN THE FACE, SENDING HIM TUMBLING. A1 HULK BASHES HIS WAY THROUGH THE LOBBY. The Tesseract Case hits the floor, popping open. THE TESSERACT FALLS OUT, spinning past Tiny Scott... STOPPING AT LOKI’S FEET. Loki stares at it in disbelief. He glances at A1 Thor and Pierce giving A1 Tony first aid. THEN LOKI CALMLY REACHES DOWN WITH HIS MANACLED HANDS, GRASPS THE TESSERACT...AND TELEPORTS AWAY. Scott stares, stunned.
C: SCOTT LANG
D: That wasn’t supposed to happen, was it?
N: A1 THOR LOOKS UP, REALIZING...
C: A1 THOR
D: WHERE’S LOKI?
N: SHIELD TEAMS FAN OUT, ON ALERT.

C: STEVE
D: Oh, great.
C: A1 STEVE
D: Disregard. I have eyes on Loki, Fourteenth Floor. 75
E: INTO COM
N: STEVE GENTLY LAYS THE SCEPTER DOWN, AND PULLS OFF HIS SHIELD.
C: STEVE
D: I’m not Loki. And I don’t want to hurt you.
N: A1 STEVE PULLS HIS SHIELD OFF HIS BACK.
C: A1 STEVE
D: You’re not going to get the chance-
N: A1 STEVE KICKS STEVE IN THE FACE. Steve stumbles.
C: STEVE
D: Forgot about that one.
N: They grapple. Both their shields fall to the ground... THEY BOTH STAMP ON THEM, simultaneously flipping the shields back to their arms. A1 Steve looks impressed. A1 STEVE SWINGS. STEVE DUCKS, HAMMERING HIM. A1 Steve wipes the blood from his lip, squaring off.
C: A1 STEVE
D: I can do this all day-
C: STEVE
D: Yeah, I know...
N: They battle on. A1 Steve tackles Steve, knocking his shield aside, RIPPING OPEN ONE OF STEVE’S BELT COMPARTMENTS: THE COMPASS FALLS OUT, OPENING TO REVEAL PEGGY’S PICTURE. A1 Steve goes cold. He picks up the compass, FLABBERGASTED.
C: A1 STEVE
D: Where’d you get this?
C: STEVE
D: PX. Camp Lehigh. 1943.
N: A1 Steve stares at Steve, eyes narrowing.
C: A1 STEVE
D: You’ve got a lot of nerve.
N: HE HAMMERS STEVE ACROSS THE HALL. Steve goes skidding. He groans, looking up to see...HE’S INCHES FROM THE SCEPTER. A1 STEVE moves in. STEVE whips around, touching THE SCEPTER to A1 Steve’s chest. A1 STEVE’S EYES GO BLACK. HE FREEZES. Steve stares, panting. Finally, he picks up the compass from the floor, then considers A1 STEVE’S ASS.
C: STEVE
D: That is America’s ass.
S: EXT. SANCTUM SANCTORUM, ROOF - DAY (AVENGERS 1)
N: SMART HULK’S BODY lies slumped on an Adirondack chair, a floppy sun hat covering his face.
C: ANCIENT ONE
D: I wish I could help you, Bruce...
E: O.S.
N: THE ANCIENT ONE waters a rooftop garden. She looks to ASTRAL BANNER, who’s only just getting used to being see-through.
C: ANCIENT ONE
D: But if I were to give up the Time Stone to help your reality, I’d be dooming my own.
E: CONT'D
C: ASTRAL BANNER
D: Yeah, with all due respect, I’m not sure the science supports that.
C: ANCIENT ONE
D: And yet, you’re the one currently standing in the middle of my hydrangeas.
N: Banner looks down to see, indeed, he has phased through the middle of the hydrangeas. He steps out of it.
C: ASTRAL BANNER
D: Lady, I just want to borrow your necklace-
C: ANCIENT ONE
D: At what cost?
N: SHE CONJURES A MAGICAL PROJECTION OF THE INFINITY STONES, SPINNING IN UNISON. A TUNNEL OF GOLDEN LIGHT POURS FORTH.
C: ANCIENT ONE
D: The Infinity Stones create the experience you know as the flow of time. Remove one of the stones, and the flow splits.
E: CONT'D
N: She plucks the GREEN TIME STONE out of the array: A SMALLER, BLACKENED RIVER BRANCHES OFF FROM THE FIRST.
C: ANCIENT ONE
D: Now, your timeline might benefit. My new one...would definitely not.
E: CONT'D
N: SHE GESTURES. OUR CAMERA ZOOMS INTO THE BLACKENED TUNNEL... TUNNEL POV: HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE RUN AS WE FLY OVER A CROWDED STREET, UP TO...THE BURNING HONG KONG SANCTUM.
C: ANCIENT ONE
D: In this new branch reality, without our chief weapon against the forces of darkness, our world would be overrun...
E: O.S. CONT'D
N: MOVE UP TO SEE DORMAMMU IN THE SKY. HE OPENS HIS MOUTH... BACK ON THE ROOF...THE ANCIENT ONE PLUCKS MORE STONES FROM THE GOLDEN RIVER, CREATING FIVE MORE BLACKENED TRIBUTARIES.
C: ANCIENT ONE
D: For each stone you remove, you’ll create a new, vulnerable timeline. Millions will suffer. Now tell me, Doctor. Can your science prevent all that?
E: CONT'D beat
C: ASTRAL BANNER
D: No. But it can erase it.
N: Astral Banner reaches in and grabs THE VIRTUAL TIME STONE.
C: ASTRAL BANNER
D: Because once we’re done with the stones, we can return each one to its own timeline. At the moment it was taken. So chronologically, in that reality, the stone never left.
E: CONT'D
N: HE PUTS THE TIME STONE BACK. THE BLACK TIMELINE DISAPPEARS.
C: ANCIENT ONE
D: You’re leaving out the most important part, though. In order to put the stones back, you’d have to survive.
C: ASTRAL BANNER
D: We will. I will. I promise.
C: ANCIENT ONE
D: I can’t risk this reality on a promise. 78
E: MORE
C: ANCIENT ONE
D: It is the duty of the Sorcerer Supreme to protect the Time Stone-
E: CONT'D
C: ASTRAL BANNER
D: Yeah? Then why the hell did Strange give it away?
N: The Ancient One freezes.
C: ANCIENT ONE
D: What did you say?
C: ASTRAL BANNER
D: Strange gave Thanos the Time Stone.
C: ANCIENT ONE
D: Willingly? Why?
C: ASTRAL BANNER
D: Don’t know. Maybe he made a mistake.
C: ANCIENT ONE
D: Or I did.
N: The Ancient One looks out over a recovering NYC.
C: ANCIENT ONE
D: Strange is meant to be the best of us.
E: CONT'D
C: ASTRAL BANNER
D: Then he must have had a reason.
C: ANCIENT ONE
D: I fear you may be right...
N: Finally, she waves her hand and...WHOOSH! HE REINTEGRATES INTO THE SMART HULK BODY. Smart Hulk gets up, WOOZY. SHE REMOVES THE TIME STONE FROM THE EYE, HANDING IT TO HIM.
C: SMART HULK
D: Thank you.
C: ANCIENT ONE
D: I’m counting on you, Bruce. We all are.

C: THANOS
D: Run diagnostics. Show me her memory file.
N: At the console, EBONY MAW SCANS NEBULA’S INFORMATION. NEBULA’S BODY TWITCHES. GAMORA WATCHES, TORN. SOON...AN ALERT FLASHES.
C: EBONY MAW
D: Sir, the file appears...entangled. It was a memory, but not hers. There’s another consciousness sharing her network. Another Nebula.
E: dawning on him
C: THANOS
D: Impossible.
C: EBONY MAW
D: This duplicate carries a time stamp...from nine years in the future.
C: THANOS
D: Where is this “other Nebula?”
C: EBONY MAW
D: In our solar system. On Morag.
C: THANOS
D: Can you access her?
C: EBONY MAW
D: Yes. The two are linked.
N: THANOS PEERS INTO BAD NEBULA’S GLASSY EYES...
C: THANOS
D: Search the duplicate’s memory for Infinity Stones.
N: Maw works the console. Thanos steps aside as BAD NEBULA’S BODY QUIVERS. AFTER A BEAT, A BEAM SHOOTS OUT OF HER EYE... PROJECTING AN IMAGE OF AVENGERS COMPOUND: STEVE, TONY, RHODEY, SCOTT, SMART HULK, ROCKET, NATASHA, CLINT, AND THOR GATHER IN THE LIVING AREA.
C: SMART HULK
D: -the Stones have been in a lot of places throughout history.

E: CONT'D
N: EBONY MAW ZOOMS IN, REVEALING...A REFLECTION OF NEBULA.

E: to Ebony Maw beat
S: INT. ASGARD, PALACE, CORRIDOR - DAY (THOR 2)
N: Frigga walks down a corridor, alone. THOR SNEAKS FROM COLUMN TO COLUMN, FOLLOWING HER. She PAUSES, sensing something. Thor HIDES. When he peers again, FRIGGA IS GONE. Then he turns around to find FRIGGA STANDING BESIDE HIM. Thor jumps.
C: FRIGGA
D: What are you doing?
C: THOR
D: Mother! What? Nothing. Hello.
C: FRIGGA
D: You’re better off leaving the sneaking to your brother. What are you wearing?
E: re. his bathrobe
C: THOR
D: I always wear this. It’s one of my favorites.
C: FRIGGA
D: And what’s wrong with your eye?
C: THOR
D: Oh, that. You remember the...Battle of Harokin. I took a...broadsword to the face?
N: He trails off, at a loss, staring at his dead mom. Frigga gently lays her hand on his cheek...READING HIM.
C: FRIGGA
D: Oh. You’re not the Thor I know at all, are you?
C: THOR
D: Yes, I am-
C: FRIGGA
D: I was raised by witches, boy. I see with more than eyes, you know that. I can see the future hasn’t been kind to you, has it?
E: eyeing him
C: THOR
D: I didn’t say I was from the future... 82
C: FRIGGA
D: Thor...
N: Frigga gives her son a stern, “don’t lie to me” look. Thor stares at his mom a long moment. Then, he cracks:
C: THOR
D: I’m totally from the future.
C: FRIGGA
D: Yes, you are.
C: THOR
D: I need to talk to you.
C: FRIGGA
D: We can talk.

N: FRIGGA sits with THOR in her chambers.
C: THOR
D: ...and then it was done. His head over there. Body over there. And me in the middle. Just an idiot with an axe.
C: FRIGGA
D: You’re no idiot. You’re here, aren’t you? Seeking counsel from the smartest person in Asgard?
C: THOR
D: Yeah, I guess.
C: FRIGGA
D: An idiot, no. A failure, absolutely. 83
C: THOR
D: That’s a little harsh-
C: FRIGGA
D: Quite a colossal one, by the sound of it.
C: THOR
D: Okay, maybe just stop talking.
C: FRIGGA
D: And you know what that makes you? Just like everyone else.
C: THOR
D: I’m not supposed to be like everyone else, though.
C: FRIGGA
D: Everyone fails at “who they’re supposed to be,” Thor. The measure of a person, of a hero, is how well they succeed at being who they are.
N: Thor stares at her, biting back emotions.
C: THOR
D: I’ve really missed you, Mum.
S: INT. ASGARD, PALACE, CORRIDOR - DAY (THOR 2)

D: No, son. You don’t. You’ve come to repair your future, not mine.
C: THOR
D: But your future- 84
C: FRIGGA
D: Is none of my business.

D: Hi. You must be Mom. I got the thing. Come on, we gotta move-
E: to Frigga to Thor, re. the device
N: Thor looks to Frigga.
C: THOR
D: I wish we had more time-
C: FRIGGA
D: This was a gift. Now, go be the man you’re meant to be. And eat a salad.
E: beat
N: Thor smiles. He and Rocket activate their time suits.
C: ROCKET
D: Three...two-
C: THOR
D: No. Wait.
N: THOR DRAMATICALLY HOLDS OUT HIS HAND. A long moment passes.
C: ROCKET
D: What am I looking at?
C: FRIGGA
D: Sometimes it takes a second.
N: Then...MJOLNIR SAILS INTO HER SON’S HAND. She grins, proud.
C: THOR
D: Still worthy.
E: relieved
N: Mother and son look at each other for the last time.
C: THOR
D: Goodbye, Mum.
E: CONT'D
C: FRIGGA

N: THEN, WHOOSH! THOR AND ROCKET DISAPPEAR. Suddenly...THE PALACE RUMBLES. Frigga looks to the window, WHERE A DARK ELF WARSHIP DECLOAKS. SHE REACHES FOR A SWORD. PRELAP: “COME AND GET YOUR LOVE,” BY REDBONE.
S: EXT. MORAG, ABANDONED CITY - DAY (GUARDIANS)
N: PETER QUILL, in RED, PLEATHER TRENCH COAT AND HEADPHONES, dances through the ruins of an alien city. PULL BACK TO...NEBULA AND RHODEY WATCHING FROM BEHIND A ROCK.
C: RHODEY
D: So, he’s an idiot.

N: Quill spins, arms out, eyes shut. When the horizon finally settles...he sees A METAL MAN STANDING THERE WAITING FOR HIM.
C: QUILL
D: Oh, fu-
N: BAM! RHODEY DECKS QUILL IN THE FACE. Quill drops, out cold.
C: RHODEY
D: Sorry about that. I know you guys were teammates and everything.
C: NEBULA
D: Do you hear me complaining?
N: Nebula rifles through Quill’s sack. She pulls out AN ELECTRONIC LOCK PICK.
C: RHODEY
D: What is that?
C: NEBULA
D: The tool of a thief. Come on.
N: They set out toward the RUINED CITY.
S: INT. MORAG, TEMPLE VAULT - DAY (GUARDIANS)
N: WHIR, CLICK. TWO HUGE, STONE DOORS SLIDE OPEN, REVEALING NEBULA AND RHODEY. SHE STEPS IN. RHODEY TRIES TO STOP HER.
C: RHODEY
D: Hang on. This would be about the time the spikes come out, you know, with the skeletons still on them?
C: NEBULA
D: What are you talking about?
C: RHODEY
D: I’m just saying, when you break into a place called, “The Temple of the Power Stone”, there are usually...
N: Ahead, they see...THE POWER STONE ORB HOVERING ABOVE ITS PEDESTAL, SURROUNDED BY A WEB OF LASER THREADS.
C: RHODEY
D: Traps and stuff. Okay, don’t say I didn’t warn you.
E: CONT'D Nebula steps inside
N: Rhodey scans the laser web, strategizing.
C: RHODEY

E: CONT'D
N: SUDDENLY, NEBULA REACHES HER CYBERNETIC ARM THROUGH THE WEB. SHE GRABS THE ORB...BUT THE WEB GRIPS HER, FRYING HER ARM. She pulls out the orb, but sees Rhodey staring at HER BLACKENED CLAW.
C: NEBULA
D: I wasn’t always like this.
N: He sees actual emotion somewhere inside her. Favor his exoskeletal leg braces as he softens.
C: RHODEY
D: Yeah, me either. I guess we do the best with what we’ve got, huh?
N: SHE HANDS HIM THE ORB WITH JUST THE GHOST OF A SMILE.
C: RHODEY
D: Let’s get out of here. Place gives me the creeps. Sync up. Three... two...one... 87
E: CONT'D
N: RHODEY TAPS HIS CUFF, SHRINKING AWAY. Nebula goes for hers...BUT HER EYES ROLL BACK. SHE COLLAPSES, SEIZING VIOLENTLY, THEN GOING STILL. Her eyes snap open, projecting a hologram of...THANOS.
C: THANOS
D: What’s wrong?
E: HOLO
S: INT. SANCTUARY-2, INTERROGATION CELL - DAY
N: BACK IN THE INTERROGATION CELL, BAD NEBULA’S EYE BEAMS: IN THANOS’ LODGE, THE AVENGERS SURROUND A ONE-ARMED THANOS. THANOS STUDIES HIS HOLO-FUTURE-SELF, WATCHING HIS DESTINY PLAY OUT IN FRONT OF HIM.
C: BRUCE BANNER
D: You murdered trillions.
E: HOLO
C: THANOS
D: You should be grateful.
E: HOLO
C: NATASHA
D: Where are the stones?
E: HOLO
N: THANOS SMIRKS, PUTTING THE PIECES TOGETHER.
C: THANOS
D: Gone. Reduced to atoms.
E: HOLO
C: BRUCE BANNER
D: You used them two days ago!
E: HOLO
C: THANOS
D: I used the stones to destroy the stones. The work is done. It always will be...
E: HOLO
N: HE STEPS FORWARD, FINISHING HIS OWN THOUGHT. THANOS (HOLO) (CONT'D) THANOS (CONT'D) I AM INEVITABLE- I AM INEVITABLE. Thanos nods to Maw, who freezes the program. THANOS WALKS THROUGH THE HOLOGRAM, STUDYING THE HEROES.
C: GAMORA
D: What did you do to them?
C: THANOS
D: Nothing. Yet. 88
E: piecing it together MORE
C: THANOS
D: They’re not trying to stop something I’m going to do in our time. They’re trying to undo something I’ve already done in theirs.
E: CONT'D
C: GAMORA
D: The stones.
E: uneasy
C: THANOS
D: I found them all. I won. Tipped the cosmic scales to balance.
C: EBONY MAW
D: Sire. This is your future?
C: THANOS
D: My destiny.
N: He stares, mind whirling. He nods. THE MEMORY RESUMES.
C: RHODEY
D: He’s lying.
E: HOLO
C: NEBULA
D: My father is many things. A liar is not one of them.
E: O.S.
C: THANOS
D: Thank you, daughter. Perhaps I’ve treated you too-
E: HOLO
N: WHUMP. THOR CUTS OFF THANOS’ HEAD. THE VIEW LINGERS AS “NEBULA” STARES AT HER DEAD FATHER. THANOS STUDIES HIS SEVERED HEAD...AND SMILES.
C: THANOS
D: And that is destiny fulfilled.
E: CONT'D
N: Gamora stares, torn. But Ebony Maw fumes on Thanos’ behalf.
C: EBONY MAW
D: Sire. Your daughter is a traitor.
N: EBONY MAW GESTURES: CABLES WRAP AROUND NEBULA’S NECK. SHE AWAKENS, PANICKED. She looks up at Thanos.
C: BAD NEBULA
D: No. Please, father. That’s not me. I would never betray you. Please- 89
E: choking
N: Thanos UNWRAPS the cord. He touches his daughter’s face.
C: THANOS
D: Ssh, child. I know. And you’ll have the chance to prove it...
S: INT. MORAG, TEMPLE VAULT - DAY (GUARDIANS)
N: ZZZT. ON THE FLOOR, NEBULA’S EYES SNAP OPEN, HORRIFIED.
C: NEBULA
D: He knows...
S: EXT. MORAG - DAY (GUARDIANS)
N: BOOTS POUND ACROSS THE ROCKS. NEBULA RUNS FLAT OUT, DESPERATE, HEADING FOR THE ESCAPE POD.
S: INT. ESCAPE POD - DAY (GUARDIANS)
N: NEBULA rushes to the console and opens A COMMUNICATION LINK.
C: NEBULA
D: Barton, Romanoff, come in. We have a problem. Thanos knows! Thanos-
E: INTO COM
N: Suddenly, A SHADOW falls over the Pod. Nebula looks out the cockpit window... AS A TRACTOR BEAM PULLS THE ENTIRE POD SKYWARD.
S: EXT. NEW YORK CITY, ALLEY - (AVENGERS 1)
N: IN THE ALLEY, Steve drops down from the building. He hears A WHISTLE. TONY waves from behind a crashed car.
C: TONY
D: We’ve got a problem.
T: TIME CUT:
N: STEVE huddles with TONY and SCOTT.
C: STEVE
D: How could you lose it?
C: TONY
D: What do you want? I got hit in the head with a Hulk! 90
C: SCOTT LANG
D: You said we only had one shot. This was our shot. We shot it. It was six stones or nothing! Six stones-
C: TONY
D: You’re not helping-
C: SCOTT LANG
D: You ruined the Time Heist!
C: TONY
D: Okay, okay, Loki’s from Asgard, he’s comfortable there. Knows the restaurants. It’s a safe bet he visits home. If we can just grab This-Thor and explain the situation, he and I can fly-
C: STEVE
D: Loki could be anywhere in the universe. We’d be old men before we found him.
N: As Steve and Scott debate, MOVE IN ON TONY, MIND WHIRLING...
C: STEVE
D: What other options did we have on the Tesseract?
E: CONT'D
C: SCOTT LANG
D: Whoa, whoa. We don’t have any other options. We can’t go to any other times. No do-overs! We’ve only got one particle left, each. Use it now, that’s it, bye-bye, we don’t come home.
C: STEVE
D: But if we don’t try, nobody else comes home, either.
C: TONY
D: I got it! There’s another way to re-take the Tesseract, and acquire new particles. Military installation, Garden State.
E: to Steve
N: Steve eyes Tony, BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND.
C: STEVE
D: When were they both there?
C: TONY
D: I have a vaguely exact idea.
C: STEVE
D: How vague?
C: SCOTT LANG
D: Hang on, what’s in New Jersey?
C: TONY
D: I know they were there, and I know how I know.
N: STEVE STUDIES TONY A LONG MOMENT...
C: STEVE
D: Looks like we’re improvising.
C: SCOTT LANG
D: Wait! What are you improvising?
N: STEVE HANDS SCOTT THE STAFF.
C: STEVE
D: Scott, take this back to the Compound.
C: TONY
D: All right, suits on. Try these coordinates. 04-07-19-70...
C: SCOTT LANG
D: Steve- Cap- Captain America, if you do this and he’s wrong...you’re not coming back.
N: Steve and Tony let the weight of that sink in. He’s right. Even so, Tony turns to Steve.
C: TONY
D: You trust me?
C: STEVE
D: I do.
N: THEY STARE AT EACH OTHER, THEN...CLICK. THEY BOTH HIT THEIR CUFFS. TONY AND STEVE SHRINK TO NOTHING...
S: EXT. NEW JERSEY WOODS - DAY (1970)
N: CUE MUSIC: “HEY LAWDY MAMA,” STEPPENWOLF. A 1970 Oldsmobile motors down a wooded road. The bumper sticker reads: “NUFF SAID.” At the wheel, STAN LEE (48), LONG HAIR, MOUSTACHE, OPEN SHIRT, sings along to the radio, TWO LADIES at his side. He passes by AN ARMY BASE, throwing a peace sign to A GUARD.
C: STAN LEE
D: Make love, not war, baby!
N: He roars off, passing A FADED SIGN: “U.S. ARMY - CAMP LEHIGH - BIRTHPLACE OF CAPTAIN AMERICA.” MOVE INTO THE BASE...
C: TONY
D: You weren’t actually born here, right?
E: O.S.
S: EXT. CAMP LEHIGH - DAY (1970)
N: SOLDIERS MARCH PAST AS... Tony and Steve round the corner, TONY IN A LAB COAT and STEVE IN GREEN KHAKIS, LOW-PULLED CAP, AND MIRRORED SUNGLASSES.
C: STEVE
D: The idea of me was.
C: TONY
D: All right. If I was SHIELD and I wanted to hide my quasi-fascistic black site, where would I hide it?
E: looking around
C: STEVE
D: In plain sight.
N: Steve nods at A MAN IN A GRAY SUIT approaching a building, “MUNITIONS.” He opens the door with a retro-tech PUNCH CARD. TONY TOUCHES HIS GLASSES: HE X-RAYS INTO THE GROUND, ILLUMINATING...TWENTY FLOORS OF SECRET, UNDERGROUND BASE.
S: INT. CAMP LEHIGH, ELEVATOR - DAY (1970)
N: Muzak plays as STEVE and TONY ride down with A FEMALE SHIELD
C: AGENT.
D: 93
N: She stares awkwardly at Tony. Steve keeps his hat down. Ding. The doors open. Tony exits, then turns back to Steve.
C: TONY
D: Good luck with that mission, Captain.
C: STEVE
D: Good luck with your project, Doctor.
N: Tony ducks out. The doors close. The Agent turns to Steve.
C: FEMALE SHIELD AGENT
D: You new here?
C: STEVE
D: Not exactly.
S: INT. CAMP LEHIGH, SHIELD FACILITY, ARCHIVES - DAY (1970)
N: TONY searches HIGH, CROWDED ARCHIVE SHELVES.
C: TONY
D: Come on, you little hexahedron, where are you hiding?
N: Finally, he spots A HIGH TECH SAFE. He grabs a briefcase, then NANOS A GAUNTLET, FRYING THE SAFE’S LOCK. It opens revealing...THE TESSERACT. Tony smiles.
C: TONY
D: You may not know it now, but someday you’re going to be a real pain-in-the-ass.
E: CONT'D
N: Just then...THE ARCHIVE DOOR OPENS.
C: HOWARD STARK
D: Hey, Arnim, you in here?
E: O.S.
N: TONY LOCKS THE CUBE IN THE BRIEFCASE JUST BEFORE... HOWARD STARK (49) APPEARS, carrying ROSES AND A CAN OF SAUERKRAUT. TONY STARES, STUNNED.
C: HOWARD STARK
D: Hey, I’m looking for Dr. Zola. You seen him?
E: CONT'D
C: TONY
D: No. Haven’t seen a soul. 94
N: Tony stands in front of his father, overwhelmed. Howard looks at him, a bit suspicious.
C: HOWARD STARK
D: I know you?
N: From his pocket, TONY GENERATES A BADGE OUT OF NANO-TECH. He holds it out.
C: TONY
D: No, sir. Just visiting from MIT.
C: HOWARD STARK
D: That so? Got a name?
C: TONY
D: Howard...
C: HOWARD STARK
D: Easy to remember-
C: TONY
D: Potts.
C: HOWARD STARK
D: I’m Howard Stark. You seem a little green around the gills, Potts. Need some air?
E: shaking hands
C: TONY
D: That’d be swell.
N: Tony distractedly walks away, leaving the briefcase.
C: HOWARD STARK
D: Need the briefcase?
N: PRE-LAP A RINGING PHONE...
S: INT. CAMP LEHIGH, SHIELD FACILITY, PYM’S LAB - DAY (1970)
N: CLOSE ON: AN ANT. A phone continues to ring. Then...
C: HANK PYM
D: Hello?
E: O.S.
N: PULL BACK: THE ANT CRAWLS IN AN ANTFARM ON A LAB SHELF.
C: STEVE
D: Dr. Pym? 95
E: OVER PHONE
C: HANK PYM
D: That would be the number you called, yes.
E: O.S.
N: PAN across the shelf to A CHART OF WASP MATURATION.
C: STEVE
D: This is Captain Stevens, from shipping. We have a package for you.
E: OVER PHONE
N: KEEP PANNING to A PROTOTYPE ANT-MAN HELMET.
C: HANK PYM
D: So bring it up.
E: O.S.
C: STEVE
D: That’s the thing, sir, we can’t.
E: OVER PHONE
N: ARRIVE ON...HANK PYM (20’s), in brown hair and lab coat.
C: HANK PYM
D: Maybe I’m confused. Isn’t that your job?
C: STEVE
D: It’s just...sir, the box is glowing. And to be honest, a couple of our mail guys aren’t feeling great-
E: OVER PHONE
C: HANK PYM
D: They didn’t open it, did they?!
S: INT. CAMP LEHIGH, SHIELD FACILITY, HALLWAY - DAY (1970)
N: A DOOR MARKED, “DR. HENRY PYM,” flies open. Hank exits, fuming, brushing past...STEVE. Steve watches Hank stalk off...THEN DUCKS INTO HANK’S LAB.
S: INT. CAMP LEHIGH, SHIELD FACILITY, ELEVATOR - DAY (1970)
N: HOWARD and TONY step onto AN ELEVATOR. The doors shut.
C: TONY
D: Sauerkraut and a bouquet...big night planned? 96
C: HOWARD STARK
D: My wife’s expecting. And too much time at the office.
E: lifting one at a time
N: Tony puzzles the dates out in his head...
C: TONY
D: Congratulations.
C: HOWARD STARK
D: Thanks.
C: TONY
D: How far along is she?
C: HOWARD STARK Gee, I suppose...
D: ...this far. She’s at the point where she can’t stand the sound of my chewing. So I guess I’ll be eating in the pantry again.
E: indicating
C: TONY
D: I have a little girl.
N: TONY SMILES. He’s talking about the man-he’s-talking-to’s granddaughter, fifty years before she’s born.
C: HOWARD STARK
D: A girl would be nice. Less chance she’d turn out exactly like me.
C: TONY
D: Would that be so bad?
C: HOWARD STARK
D: Let’s just say the greater good hasn’t always outweighed my own self interest.
N: The elevator doors open.
S: INT. CAMP LEHIGH, SHIELD FACILITY, PYM’S LAB - DAY (1970)
N: STEVE searches Hank’s lab, finally opening the fridge to find...A TRAY OF BRAND NEW PYM PARTICLES.
S: INT. CAMP LEHIGH, SHIELD FACILITY, HALLWAY - DAY (1970)
N: Steve exits Hank’s lab and heads for the elevator. But it opens, revealing THE FEMALE AGENT FROM EARLIER, WITH AN M.P.
C: M.P.
D: You’ve never seen either of these men before?
C: FEMALE SHIELD AGENT
D: No. But I have an eye for this. Something looked fishy.
C: M.P.
D: Describe ‘fishy’.
C: FEMALE SHIELD AGENT
D: One of them had a hippie beard.
C: M.P.
D: We talking Bee Gees or Mungo Jerry?
C: FEMALE SHIELD AGENT
D: Definitely Mungo Jerry.
C: M.P.
D: This is Chesler. We need every available agent to sub-level 6. We have a potential breach.
E: over walkie-talkie
N: Steve ducks through the nearest door...
S: INT. CAMP LEHIGH, SHIELD FACILITY, PEGGY’S OFC. - DAY (1970)
N: Steve enters a darkened office. A glass wall separates it from another bullpen. Then he sees something on the desk. He stares, stunned, at two photos: one features PEGGY CARTER STANDING WITH JFK. THE OTHER IS OF SKINNY STEVE. Steve turns the desk nameplate around: “MARGARET CARTER.” Steve realizes that even twenty-five years later, Peggy never forgot about him. Just then, THE BULLPEN DOOR FLIES OPEN. LIGHTS SNAP ON, revealing PEGGY CARTER (49), talking to someone in the hall.
C: PEGGY CARTER
D: So, send them in. 98
C: MALE AGENT
D: They’re trying, ma’am, but Braddock’s unit has been stopped by lightning strikes.
C: PEGGY CARTER
D: Oh, for the love of- I’ll find the weather projections. You call Braddock and tell him to shelter in place. Assuming he’s bright enough to come out of the rain.
C: MALE AGENT
D: Yes, ma’am.
E: O.S.
N: Steve stares at her from the darkness, STUNNED. Peggy rifles through a file cabinet.
C: PEGGY CARTER
D: Here we are...
N: She flips through a file, reading. In the darkness behind her, Steve approaches. Peggy reads something disturbing.
C: PEGGY CARTER
D: Crikey O’Reilly. Sergeant? Hang up and call Air Command. Braddock needs back up, immediately.
E: CONT'D calling out
C: MALE AGENT
D: Ma’am?
C: PEGGY CARTER
D: Those aren’t lightning strikes he’s looking at...
N: She slaps the file closed and hurries out. Steve stares after her a long moment.
S: EXT. CAMP LEHIGH - DAY (1970)
N: Howard and Tony approach a WAITING LIMO.
C: TONY
D: Got any names, yet?
C: HOWARD STARK
D: If it’s a boy, my wife likes Elmonzo. 99
C: TONY
D: You might let that stew a while. You’ve got time.
C: HOWARD STARK
D: What are you, couple years older than me?
C: TONY
D: Yeah. I guess.
C: HOWARD STARK
D: Let me ask you a question. When your kid was born...were you nervous?
C: TONY
D: Wildly.
C: HOWARD STARK
D: Did you feel qualified? Like you had any idea how to successfully operate that thing?
C: TONY
D: I pieced it together as I went along. I thought about what my dad did...
C: HOWARD STARK
D: My old man never met a problem he couldn’t solve with a belt.
C: TONY
D: I tried to hold onto the good stuff. Dad dropped the odd pearl, here and there.
C: HOWARD STARK
D: Like what?
C: TONY
D: “No amount of money ever bought a second of time.”
C: HOWARD STARK
D: That’s good. Smart guy.
C: TONY
D: He did his best. 100
C: HOWARD STARK
D: I tell you, this kid’s not even here yet, but there’s nothing I wouldn’t do for him.
N: Tony takes this in, GRATIFIED. Just then...EDWIN JARVIS (56) opens the limo door.
C: HOWARD STARK
D: Besides, if I fall down on the fathering job, old Jarvis is ready to pick up the slack. Isn’t that right?
E: CONT'D
C: EDWIN JARVIS
D: Indeed, sir. I shall endeavor to teach the lad the rudiments of judo.
N: Tony smiles at his old friend. As Jarvis gets in the car, Tony notices...STEVE WAITING BEHIND A JEEP. TIME TO GO. Howard turns to shake Tony’s hand.
C: HOWARD STARK
D: Well, good to meet you, Potts.
C: TONY
D: You’re going to do fine, Howard.
C: HOWARD STARK
D: Thanks. See you around?
C: TONY
D: Count on it...
N: As he gets into his car, Howard looks to Jarvis.
C: HOWARD STARK
D: Have we met him before?
C: EDWIN JARVIS
D: We’ve met a lot of people, sir.
C: HOWARD STARK
D: Seems very familiar. Weird beard.
E: beat
S: EXT. SANCTUARY 2 - SPACE
N: The Sanctuary-2 cruises ominously through space.
S: INT. SANCTUARY-2, PRISON CELL - DAY
N: WHACK! NEBULA GOES TUMBLING ACROSS THE FLOOR. She gets to her knees, looking up at...BAD NEBULA, GLARING DOWN AT HER.
C: BAD NEBULA
D: You’re weak.
C: NEBULA
D: I’m you-
C: BAD NEBULA
D: Shut up!
N: BAD NEBULA PUNCHES GOOD NEBULA DOWN. GOOD NEBULA GROANS AS BAD NEBULA RIPS OFF HER TIME-SPACE GPS. THEN GAMORA ENTERS. Nebula softens, taking in her (once dead) sister.
C: NEBULA
D: You could stop this. You know you want to. Did you see what happens in the future? Thanos finds the Soul Stone.
E: off Gamora’s look
N: MOVE IN ON GAMORA, WHEELS TURNING...
C: NEBULA
D: You want to know how he does that? You want to know what he does to you-
E: CONT'D
C: BAD NEBULA
D: ENOUGH!
N: BAD NEBULA SMACKS HER THE HARDEST YET, THEN LEANS IN WITH A JAGGED INSTRUMENT OF TORTURE.
C: BAD NEBULA
D: You disgust me...but that doesn’t mean you’re useless.
E: CONT'D
N: SHE PRIES OFF THE ORANGE PANEL FROM GOOD NEBULA’S HEAD. Gamora takes in this new development...
S: INT. SANCTUARY-2, THRONE ROOM - DAY
N: Bad Nebula enters to find Thanos on his throne. She hands him Good Nebula’s TIME-SPACE GPS. He smiles. Bad Nebula affixes Good Nebula’s orange panel onto her head.
C: BAD NEBULA
D: How do I look?
S: EXT. BENATAR - SPACE
N: THE BENATAR approaches Vormir. TITLE: VORMIR, 2014
S: INT. BENATAR, FLIGHT DECK - SPACE
N: NATASHA and CLINT stand on the flight deck, staring at THE MAJESTIC, PURPLE PLANET.
S: CLINT BARTON
N: Under different circumstances, this would be totally awesome.
S: EXT. VORMIR - DAY
N: Clint and Natasha eye THE BENATAR resting on a sand dune. Clint fires a Pym Particle. WHOOSH, THE ENTIRE SHIP DISAPPEARS. CLINT lifts THE SHRUNKEN BENATAR and tucks it in his pocket.
S: CLINT AND NATASHA TREK ACROSS THE DUNES OF VORMIR,
N: TOWARD...THE MOUNTAIN.
S: EXT. VORMIR, MIDWAY UP THE MOUNTAIN - DAY
N: Natasha and Clint climb, ragged. They approach AN ARCHWAY.
S: CLINT BARTON
N: Really starting to regret my choice here.
C: NATASHA
D: Yeah. I’m gonna bet the raccoon didn’t have to climb a mountain.
S: CLINT BARTON
N: I don’t think technically he’s a raccoon...
C: NATASHA
D: Whatever. He eats garbage- 103
N: THEY HEAR SOMETHING. THEY WHIRL, WEAPONS UP. A HOODED FIGURE APPROACHES.
C: HOODED FIGURE
D: I assure you, you have nothing to fear from me.
S: CLINT BARTON
N: Creepy.
C: HOODED FIGURE
D: Welcome Natasha, daughter of Ivan. Clint, son of Edith.
S: CLINT BARTON
N: Creepier.
C: NATASHA
D: Who are you?
C: RED SKULL
D: Consider me a guide. To you, and to all who seek the Soul Stone.
C: NATASHA
D: Great. You show us where it is, and we’ll be on our way.
N: The figure removes his hood, revealing...THE RED SKULL.
C: RED SKULL
D: Oh, liebchen. If only it were that easy...
S: EXT. VORMIR, MOUNTAIN TOP - DAY
N: START ON JAGGED ROCKS. TILT UP TO SEE SKULL, NATASHA, and CLINT staring down from the ALTAR.
C: RED SKULL
D: What you seek lies in front of you. As does what you fear.
C: NATASHA
D: The Stone is down there?
C: RED SKULL
D: For one of you. For the other... The Stone demands a sacrifice. In order to take it, you must leave behind that which you love. 104
E: smiling it away
N: SKULL POINTS A BONY FINGER DOWN THE WELL.
C: RED SKULL
D: A soul for a soul.
E: CONT'D
N: Natasha and Clint stare down the well, stunned.
T: TIME CUT:
N: RED SKULL STARES DOWN THE WELL, robes whipping in the wind.
S: CLINT BARTON (O.S.)
N: Maybe he’s full of shit.
S: FIFTY FEET AWAY, AT THE MONOLITHS, NATASHA AND CLINT HUDDLE.
C: NATASHA
D: I don’t think so.
S: CLINT BARTON
N: Why, because he knew your daddy’s name?
C: NATASHA I didn’t.
D: Thanos left here with the stone, and without his daughter. You really think that’s a coincidence?
E: off his look
N: They both look out at the well, heavy.
C: NATASHA
D: Whatever it takes...
E: CONT'D under her breath
S: CLINT BARTON
N: (under his breath) Whatever it takes... Natasha goes to Clint, resolved.
C: NATASHA
D: If we don’t get the stone, billions of people are going to stay dead.
S: CLINT BARTON
N: Then I guess we both know who it has to be.
C: NATASHA
D: Yeah. Guess we do.
N: They take each other’s hand. A long goodbye beat. Except...
S: CLINT BARTON
N: I’m starting to think we don’t mean the same person.
C: NATASHA
D: For the last five years, I’ve been trying to do one thing -- get to right here. This is all it’s been about. Bringing everybody back.
S: CLINT BARTON
N: Do not get all decent on me-
C: NATASHA
D: You think I want to do it? I’m trying to save your life, you idiot-
S: CLINT BARTON
N: And I don’t want you to. (beat) Nat. You know what I’ve done. What I am now. Your life’s worth ten of mine-
C: NATASHA
D: I don’t judge people by their worst mistakes-
S: CLINT BARTON
N: Maybe you should-
C: NATASHA
D: You didn’t.
N: That stops him. He looks in her eyes, then down, giving in.
S: CLINT BARTON
N: You’re a pain in my ass, you know that? She relaxes for the briefest moment. Just then, CLINT SWEEPS OUT HER LEGS, PINNING HER DOWN.
S: CLINT BARTON (CONT'D)
N: Tell my family I love them. SHE REVERSES, SENDING HIM TUMBLING.
C: NATASHA
D: Tell them yourself.
N: SHE FIRES A WIDOW’S BITE INTO HIS CHEST AND MAKES A BREAK FOR THE CLIFF. SHE’S HALFWAY THERE WHEN... BOOM! AN EXPLODING ARROW KNOCKS HER OFF HER FEET. Clint races past her...leaping off edge of the cliff. Just as he falls... NATASHA TACKLES HIM IN MID-AIR. They drop, but NATASHA SHOOTS HER GRAPPLING LINE INTO THE CLIFF. THEY SLAM INTO THE CLIFFSIDE. She attaches the other end of her grappling line to Clint’s belt...saving his life. She slides, but he reaches out and grabs her...saving hers.
S: CLINT BARTON
N: Damn you. They hang there a long, terrible moment. CLINT’S GRASP STARTS TO LOOSEN. Finally, she looks him in the eye.
C: NATASHA
D: Let me go.
S: CLINT BARTON
N: No. Please no... The two friends stare at each other, a lifetime between them.
C: NATASHA
D: It’s okay...
S: CLINT BARTON
N: Natasha, no- Then Natasha Romanoff kicks off the cliff wall, yanking out of Clint’s grasp. She falls... Clint dangles from the grappling hook, staring down, helpless, stifling his scream. WHOOSH! THE WHOLE WORLD GOES WHITE.
S: EXT. VORMIR, BOTTOM OF THE MOUNTAIN - DAY
N: When the light fades, CLINT LIES FLOATING IN SPACE. The camera rotates until we see...IT’S A REFLECTION OF THE SKY. CLINT LIES IN THE POOL AT THE BASE OF THE MOUNTAIN. He sits up and opens his hand to see THE SOUL STONE. His eyes well.
S: INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAY
N: THE PENCIL FINALLY CLATTERS TO A STOP AS... WHOOSH, CLINT GROWS INTO THE PRESENT ALONGSIDE THE OTHERS: SMART HULK HOLDS THE EYE OF AGAMOTTO, SCOTT HAS THE SCEPTER, RHODEY THE ORB, ROCKET & THOR THE EXTRACTION DEVICE, AND TONY & STEVE THE TESSERACT. NEBULA RETRACTS HER TIME SUIT. Everyone looks around, exhausted. Amazed.
C: RHODEY
D: Are you telling me that actually worked?
C: SMART HULK
D: Did we get them all?
N: CLINT DROPS TO HIS KNEES. Steve turns, concerned.
C: STEVE
D: Clint? Are you okay?
N: Clint stares, haunted. SMART HULK realizes...
C: SMART HULK
D: Where’s Nat? WHERE’S NAT?!
E: everyone stares
N: Clint looks up at them, eyes glassy.
S: EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, RIVER - DAWN
N: SMART HULK, eyes red, stands beside a bench on the dock. Behind him, STEVE, TONY, THOR, AND CLINT STARE OUT, GRIEVING.
C: TONY
D: Do we know if she had family?
C: STEVE
D: Yeah. Us.
N: Thor turns, thrown.
C: THOR
D: Why are you doing that?
C: TONY
D: I’m just asking a question- 108
C: THOR
D: Why are we talking as if she’s dead? We have the stones. Bring her back. C’mon, stop this shit.
N: Clint squeezes away tears.
S: CLINT BARTON
N: We can’t get her back.
C: THOR
D: What’s he talking about? Of course, we can.
S: CLINT BARTON
N: It can’t be undone. That’s why.
C: THOR
D: No offense, but you’re...a very earthly being. We’re talking about space magic, here. “Can’t” seems a little definitive, don’t you think?
S: CLINT BARTON
N: Well, I know I’m a little outside my pay grade here, but, she still isn’t here, is she?
C: THOR
D: That’s my point-
S: CLINT BARTON
N: It can’t be undone. At least that’s what the red, floating guy said. But why don’t you go talk to him, okay? Why don’t you grab your hammer and fly to that place and talk to him. IT CAN’T BE UNDONE. (beat) It was supposed to be me. She sacrificed her life for that goddamn stone. She bet her life on it. That lands heavily on all of them. A moment passes. THEN SMART HULK HURLS THE BENCH INTO THE WATER. It skips across the surface like a stone.
C: SMART HULK
D: She’s not coming back. We have to make it worth it. We have to. 109
C: STEVE
D: We will.
N: PULL BACK, LEAVING OUR MOURNERS IN TABLEAU...
S: INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, WORKSHOP - DAY
N: ALL SIX INFINITY STONES rest behind safety glass. SOON, ROBOTIC ARMS ENTER FRAME, PLUCKING UP THE POWER STONE. TONY operates the arms as ROCKET and SMART HULK watch. The robot arms swing the stone over to...A NEW IRON MAN GAUNTLET. NANO-TECH SHIFTS AND SLIDES, HOLDING IT IN PLACE. Smart Hulk releases a deep breath.
T: TIME CUT:
N: THE COMPLETED GAUNTLET sits in a cradle, SIX INFINITY STONES EMBEDDED IN THE BACK. Pull back to find... SCOTT, THOR, CLINT, RHODEY, and STEVE watching TONY AND ROCKET FINE TUNE THE GLOVE.
C: ROCKET
D: All right. The glove’s ready. Question is, who’s gonna snap their freaking fingers?
N: Everyone stares a beat. Then, THOR REACHES FOR THE GAUNTLET.
C: THOR
D: I’ll do it.
C: TONY
D: Whoa, whoa, what are you doing-
C: STEVE
D: Thor, we haven’t decided who’s putting that on.
C: THOR
D: Oh. Were all of you just waiting for the right opportunity?
C: ROCKET
D: Maybe I was getting around to it-
C: SCOTT LANG
D: We should at least discuss it- 110
C: THOR
D: Staring at the thing isn’t going to bring everybody back, is it? Look, I’m the strongest Avenger. It’s my responsibility. Fate wills it so.
C: TONY
D: Hold on, hold on-
C: THOR
D: Stop it! Let me do this. Let me do something good. Something right-
C: TONY
D: That thing is channeling enough energy to light up a continent. You’re in no condition-
C: THOR
D: What do you think is coursing through my veins right now?
C: RHODEY
D: Cheez Whiz?
C: THOR
D: Lightning.
N: Smart Hulk steps toward the Gauntlet.
C: SMART HULK
D: Lightning won’t help you, pal. It’s gotta be me. You saw what those stones did to Thanos. They almost killed him. None of you could survive.
E: approaching
C: STEVE
D: And how do we know you can?
C: SMART HULK
D: We don’t. But the radiation’s mostly gamma. It’s like I was made for this...
E: beat
S: INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAY
N: THE QUANTUM TUNNEL LIES IN DARKNESS. Then, clack, the lights come on, revealing... NEBULA, STARING UP AT THE WAITING MACHINE.
S: INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, WORKSHOP - DAY
N: SMART HULK STUDIES THE GAUNTLET. The moment of truth.
C: TONY
D: Good to go?
C: SMART HULK
D: Let’s do it.
C: TONY
D: Okay, remember, everyone Thanos snapped away five years ago, you’re just bringing them back...to today. Don’t change anything from the last five years. Got it?
C: SMART HULK
D: Got it.
N: PAN AROUND as the Avengers ready themselves: STEVE steps forward, shield on his arm. SCOTT deploys his helmet. RHODEY readies his repulsors. ROCKET covers his raccoon junk and hides behind THOR. TONY armors up, then nanos a shield to protect CLINT beside him.
C: TONY
D: Friday, why don’t you go ahead and activate Barn Door Protocol?
N: STEEL DOORS SLIDE SHUT ALL AROUND THE WORKSHOP. FINALLY, SMART HULK HOLDS UP THE GAUNTLET.
C: SMART HULK
D: Everybody’s coming home...
E: under his breath
N: HE SLOWLY SLIPS HIS HAND IN THE GLOVE. SUDDENLY, HE SPASMS, TAKING IN THE POWER AS THANOS DID IN ML1. HE STRUGGLES.
C: THOR
D: What’s happening? Take it off, take if off!
C: STEVE
D: Bruce, you okay?
C: TONY
D: Talk to me, Banner. 112
C: SMART HULK
D: I’m...okay...
N: THEN SMART HULK REACHES OUT HIS HAND...AND SNAPS HIS FINGERS. CRAAAACK! THE STONES FLARE. A BRIGHT SURGE OF ENERGY RACES UP SMART HULK’S ARM. HE ROARS AS HIS EYES BLAZE GREEN. A BLAST WHITES OUT THE SCREEN.
S: INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAY
N: NEBULA studies THE QUANTUM CONSOLE. She takes off her glove, revealing A PERFECTLY INTACT ARM. THIS IS BAD NEBULA. SHE OPENS A PANEL IN HER ARM, SNAKES OUT A CABLE...AND JACKS INTO THE CONSOLE. THE QUANTUM TUNNEL boots up. AS SHE HURRIES AWAY...
S: EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND - DAY
N: FROM HIGH OVERHEAD, WE SEE THE TIME ENERGY SIGNATURE SHOOT FROM THE HANGAR. AN OMINOUS RIPPLE WARPS ACROSS THE SKY...
S: INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, WORKSHOP - DAY
N: WHOOSH! EVERYTHING COMES BACK INTO VIEW. THE GAUNTLET FALLS OFF, ROLLING ACROSS THE FLOOR. SMART HULK COLLAPSES, ARM WITHERED, SIDE BURNT BLACK. EVERYONE RUSHES OVER. Steve checks Smart Hulk’s pulse.
C: STEVE
D: Bruce!
C: TONY
D: Don’t move him!
N: Then THE BLAST DOORS OPEN, revealing the sound of...CHIRPING. SCOTT walks toward the courtyard. Smart Hulk’s eyes clear. He grasps Steve’s arm.
C: SMART HULK
D: Did it work?
N: They pause, as if it only just now occurred to them. JUST THEN...A CELL PHONE BUZZES. A STUNNED CLINT TURNS AND APPROACHES HIS PHONE. On the home screen, we see A PHOTO OF HIS WIFE: “LAURA CALLING.”
S: CLINT FINALLY PUTS THE PHONE TO HIS EAR. CLINT BARTON
N: Honey? AT THE WINDOW, SCOTT STARES AT A BIRD FEEDER. DOZENS OF CARDINALS AND FINCHES NIBBLE ON THE SEED.
C: SCOTT LANG
D: Guys, I think it-
N: BOOM! THE BUILDING EXPLODES. DEBRIS SWALLOWS THE CAMERA.
S: EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND - DAY
N: A MUSHROOM CLOUD BILLOWS OVER AVENGERS COMPOUND.
S: EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, CRATER - DAY
N: Nothing moves. The smoke clears, revealing...A BOMBED OUT CRATER A MILE WIDE. Avengers Compound has been destroyed. Then the light changes...AND THE SANCTUARY-2 parts the clouds. It hovers over the ruins like a vulture. AN ENERGY BEAM drops to the ground, releasing... THANOS, FLANKED BY A SQUAD OF OUTRIDERS. The Mad Titan looks around at the devastation he has wrought.
C: THANOS
D: Daughter?
E: INTO COM
C: BAD NEBULA
D: Yes, father...
E: OVER COM
N: OUT OF THE SMOKE WALKS ”BAD” NEBULA. Bruised and dirty.
C: THANOS
D: So this is the future. Well done.
N: She tears off THE ORANGE HEAD-PLATE.
C: BAD NEBULA
D: Thank you, Father. They suspected nothing.
C: THANOS
D: The arrogant never do. 114
N: Thanos takes off his helmet, staring up at the crater’s edge.
C: THANOS
D: Go. Find the stones. Bring them to me.
E: CONT'D
C: BAD NEBULA
D: What will you do?
C: THANOS
D: Wait.
S: INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE, RUINS - DAY
N: THE UNDERGROUND GARAGE LIES HALF-COLLAPSED. SMART HULK GRITS HIS TEETH, HOLDING UP THE CEILING WITH ONE GOOD ARM, HIS OTHER ARM BURNED AND LIFELESS. BELOW... RHODEY LIES IN THE RUBBLE, WAR MACHINE SUIT SPARKING.
C: RHODEY
D: Canopy! Canopy!
N: Rhodey’s suit RATCHETS OPEN. HE HAULS HIMSELF FREE to see...ROCKET TRAPPED UNDER RUBBLE. AS HE CRAWLS TO HIM... THE CEILING RUMBLES. SMART HULK WAVERS, MUSCLES QUIVERING.
C: RHODEY
D: Mayday! Tony. Cap. Does anybody hear me?!
E: INTO COM CONT'D
N: HE FINALLY REACHES ROCKET. Rocket wheezes, in pain.
C: RHODEY
D: Hang on!
E: CONT'D
N: RHODEY WEDGES A PIECE OF REBAR INTO THE DEBRIS. HE HEAVES, finally managing to lever it off of Rocket. THEN... THE CRACKED CEILING GIVES WAY. A MILLION GALLONS OF RIVER WATER RUSH IN. RHODEY TRIES TO KEEP HIS HEAD ABOVE WATER.
C: RHODEY
D: Mayday! Mayday! We are taking on water!
E: INTO COM CONT'D
S: INT. TOOL SHOP, RUINS - DAY
N: CLOSE ON SCOTT LANG lying on a SILVER, METAL FLOOR.
C: RHODEY
D: ...anyone...Mayday...Mayday-
E: OVER COM
N: Scott groans, coming to.
C: SCOTT LANG
D: Wait, what...?
N: REVEAL, TINY SCOTT LYING IN THE RUINS OF THE ARMORY...ON THE IRON PATRIOT HELMET.
C: ROCKET
D: Tell ‘em to...hurry...asses up-
E: OVER COM
C: RHODEY
D: ...trapped...drowning...no time...
E: OVER COM
N: Scott jumps to his feet.
C: SCOTT LANG
D: No! Wait, I’m here!
E: INTO COM
N: Scott spots WATER TRICKLING THROUGH THE CRACKED FLOOR.
S: INT. ACCESS TUNNEL - DAY
N: WATER DRIPS FROM A HOLE IN THE ROOF OF AN ACCESS TUNNEL...ONTO CLINT BARTON, LYING FACEDOWN. He groans. He opens his hand to find HIS CELLPHONE: HIS WIFE SMILES ON THE SCREEN. “LAURA, ONE MISSED CALL.” Clint stares, amazed. He winces, finding he’s been lying atop...THE GAUNTLET. It’s bashed out of shape, BUT ALL SIX STONES STILL GLEAM.
S: CLINT BARTON (INTO COM)
N: Cap? Stark? Anyone? STATIC. Then, he hears...A SCRAPING SOUND, TALONS ON CEMENT. He peers down a darkened tunnel, then unshoulders his bow. HE LOOSES A FLARE ARROW, revealing... DOZENS OF OUTRIDERS SCRABBLING ALONG THE WALLS AND CEILING.
S: CLINT GRABS THE GAUNTLET AND RUNS. THE CREATURES GIVE CHASE. INT./EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, LAB, RUINS - DAY
N: FIRES SMOULDER BENEATH THE COLLAPSED CEILING. MOVE THROUGH SMOKE TO FIND...STEVE, out cold. SOMEONE SHAKES HIM. He wakes to see TONY, HOLDING HIS SHIELD.
C: TONY
D: You lose this again, I’m keeping it.
C: STEVE
D: What happened?
C: TONY
D: Told you. We messed with time. Time messed back.
N: Woozy, Steve follows Tony through the ruins of the lab.
C: STEVE
D: Where are the others?
C: TONY
D: I read life signs, maybe 800 feet down, but it’s hard to tell.
N: They reach the edge of the crater where THOR LOOKS DOWN AT...THANOS. Sitting on a rock. Waiting.
C: TONY
D: What’s he been doing?
E: CONT'D
C: THOR
D: Absolutely nothing.
N: The three of them stare a long moment. Then, as if sensing them, Thanos turns his head...AND LOOKS THEIR WAY.
C: STEVE
D: Son of a bitch.
C: TONY
D: Yeah.
C: STEVE
D: Where are the stones?
C: TONY
D: Somewhere under all of this. All I know is...he doesn’t have ‘em.
C: STEVE
D: So we keep it that way.
N: That lands. This is their chance.
C: THOR
D: You know it’s a trap.
C: TONY DEPLOYS HIS ARMOR.
D: 117
C: TONY
D: Don’t think I care.
C: THOR
D: Just so we’re all in agreement.
N: Thor holds out his hand: MJOLNIR FLIES INTO IT. He holds out his other hand: STORMBREAKER SLAPS INTO HIS PALM. CRACK! LIGHTNING STRIKES AS HE’S COVERED IN CAPE AND ARMOR.
C: THOR
D: Let’s kill him properly this time.
E: CONT'D
N: STEVE TIGHTENS HIS SHIELD, LEADING THEM INTO THE CRATER...
S: EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, CRATER - DAY
N: Thanos sits on his rock, contemplative.
C: THANOS
D: You could not live with your own failure. And where did that bring you? Right back to me.
N: TONY APPROACHES, WARY, AS IF SNEAKING UP ON A RABID DOG. STEVE AND THOR FAN OUT ON EITHER SIDE.
C: THANOS
D: I thought by eliminating half of life, the other half would thrive. But you’ve shown me that’s impossible. Life clings to the past with bloody fingernails. As long as there are those who remember what was, there will be those unable to accept what can be. They will resist.
E: CONT'D beat
C: TONY
D: Yep. We’re all kinds of stubborn.
C: THANOS
D: I’m thankful. Because now I know what I must do.
N: Thanos reaches for his helmet.
C: THANOS
D: I will shred this universe down to its last atom. 118
E: CONT'D MORE
C: THANOS
D: And then, with the stones you’ve collected for me, create a new one, teeming with life that knows not what it has lost, but only what it has been given. A grateful universe.
E: CONT'D
C: STEVE
D: Born out of blood.
N: Thanos studies Steve as if seeing him for the first time.
C: THANOS
D: They’ll never know it.
N: THANOS DRAWS A BLADE OFF HIS BACK, TOWERING OVER THEM.
C: THANOS
D: Because you won’t be alive to tell them.
E: CONT'D
N: Tony glances over at Steve. Ready? Steve nods... JUST AS THOR CHARGES THANOS. WHAM! ALL THREE AVENGERS ATTACK, USING THEIR SKILLS IN CONCERT. THANOS STUMBLES, ON HIS HEELS. THE HEROES PUNISH HIM, RELENTLESS. PULL UP THROUGH THE HAZE, TO THE SANCTUARY-2...
S: INT. SANCTUARY-2, INTERROGATION CELL - DAY
N: NEBULA huddles alone in A PRISON CELL. After a beat...THE DOORS RATCHET OPEN. She stares into the shadows.
C: NEBULA
D: What do you want?
N: GAMORA STEPS INTO THE CELL. THE TWO SISTERS FROM DIFFERENT ERAS STARE AT EACH OTHER.
C: GAMORA
D: In the future...what happens to you and me?
C: NEBULA
D: I try to kill you. Several times. But, eventually...we become friends. We become sisters.
C: GAMORA
D: That’s hard to believe. 119
C: NEBULA
D: A lot of things that happen will be hard to believe.
N: Gamora nearly smiles. She takes a long look at Nebula. Finally...SHE HOLDS OUT HER HAND.
C: GAMORA
D: Come on. We can still stop him.
N: Nebula takes a deciding moment. Then SHE GRABS GAMORA’S HAND. One sister pulls the other to her feet.
S: INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE, RUINS - DAY
N: SMART HULK STRAINS AGAINST THE CEILING. RHODEY HANGS ONTO A PIPE AS THE WATER RISES.
C: SMART HULK
D: Rhodey. Rocket. Get out of here. Save yourselves.
N: ROCKET SURFACES FROM BELOW, GASPING.
C: ROCKET
D: No good. Couldn’t even...find a hole...small enough to abandon you through.
N: Suddenly, Smart Hulk snarls in pain as THE CEILING DROPS A FOOT. His legs buckle as he struggles against the weight. Finally he sets his jaw...AND STRAIGHTENS HIS LEGS.
C: SMART HULK
D: AAARRRGH!
S: EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, CRATER - CONTINUOUS
N: THE BUILDING RIGHTS ITSELF, LEVELING OUT.
S: INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, RUINS - DAY
N: A RAGING RIVER ROARS THROUGH THE RUINS. AFTER A BEAT...SCOTT LANG ZOOMS PAST, RIDING A PLASTIC BOTTLE CAP.
C: RHODEY
D: MAYDAY! MAYDAY!
E: OVER COM
C: SCOTT LANG HANG ON! I’M COMING!
D: 120
E: INTO COM
S: INT. ACCESS TUNNEL - DAY
N: SHRIEKING OUTRIDERS CHASE BARTON THROUGH THE TUNNELS. CLINT AFFIXES ARROW-CHARGES TO THE WALLS AS HE RUNS. Just as the Outriders are about to overtake him, Clint hits a button on his bow, DETONATING THE CHARGES... BRINGING THE ROOF DOWN ON TOP OF THE OUTRIDERS. Clint rolls, coming up directly underneath A VERTICAL SHAFT. A cluster of Outriders escape the collapse, lunging for him. Clint shoots a grappling arrow up the shaft, ascending...BUT SO DO THE OUTRIDERS, skittering up the sides. Clint draws his katana, slashing the aliens just as...
S: INT. ACCESS TUNNEL, UPPER CHAMBERS - CONTINUOUS
N: HE TUMBLES INTO THE UPPER CHAMBER. He gasps, safe. Then he looks up to see (BAD) NEBULA, LOOMING OVER HIM.
S: CLINT BARTON
N: Oh, hey. I know you. She gently takes the Gauntlet.
C: BAD NEBULA
D: Father. I have the stones.
E: INTO COM
S: CLINT BARTON
N: What- Clint tries to get up, but Nebula puts a boot in his chest and A BLASTER TO HIS HEAD...
C: GAMORA
D: Stop.
E: O.S.
N: COVERING CLINT, BAD NEBULA TURNS TO SEE...GAMORA, GUN RAISED.
C: BAD NEBULA
D: You’re betraying us?
C: GAMORA
D: Not you.
N: GOOD NEBULA steps from the shadows, hands raised, placating. Bad Nebula stares at her future self.
C: NEBULA
D: You don’t have to do this.
C: BAD NEBULA
D: I am this.
C: GAMORA
D: No. You’re not.
N: Good Nebula takes a tiny step forward. She taps her head.
C: NEBULA
D: You’ve seen what we become-
C: GAMORA
D: Sister, listen to her-
C: BAD NEBULA
D: Shut up. You’re a traitor!
C: NEBULA
D: You can change.
N: Bad Nebula struggles, her face a twisted grimace.
C: BAD NEBULA
D: He won’t let me.
N: BAD NEBULA FIRES AT GAMORA, JUST AS GOOD NEBULA DRAWS A GUN AND SHOOTS HER DOWN. BAD NEBULA DROPS. Good Nebula stares at her dead younger self, conflicted. Clint picks up the gauntlet, very confused.
S: CLINT BARTON
N: I’m not even gonna ask.
S: EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, CRATER - DAY
N: TONY’S HUD: TONY GLARES RIGHT AT US, AS... THOR SMASHES HIS HAMMERS TOGETHER, HURLING LIGHTNING INTO THE BACK OF THE IRON MAN SUIT. TONY SENDS THE RESULTING OVERLOAD AT THANOS...BUT THANOS PROPELLERS HIS BLADE, HOLDING BACK THE BLAST. THOR USES STORMBREAKER TO BAT MJOLNIR AT THANOS... THANOS SNATCHES TONY BY THE ANKLE AND USES HIM AS A SHIELD AGAINST THE ONCOMING HAMMER. WHACK! MJOLNIR PLOWS INTO THE DIRT. TONY GOES TUMBLING, OUT COLD. TONY’S HUD: FRIDAY TRIES TO REVIVE HIM.
C: FRIDAY
D: Boss? Wake up!
E: O.S.
S: INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE, RUINS - DAY
N: ROCKET, RHODEY, AND SMART HULK GULP AIR, INCHES FROM THE CEILING, FACING THE END. RHODEY GLANCES OVER AT SMART HULK.
C: RHODEY
D: See you on the other side, man.
N: They take a last breath, THEN THE WATER HITS THE CEILING.
S: EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, CRATER - DAY
N: Steve slashes at Thanos. The Titan brutally bats him aside. Thor attacks, but Thanos drives him through walls of debris. THANOS SMASHES HIS FIST INTO THOR’S FACE, OVER AND OVER. Thor calls for Stormbreaker, but Thanos intercepts it. He presses the blade into Thor’s chest, trying to drive it home. Then, across the field...MJOLNIR RISES INTO THE AIR. THANOS GRINS, ABOUT TO FINISH THOR OFF, WHEN...MJOLNIR FLIES IN, KNOCKING THE AXE OUT OF HIS HAND. Follow the hammer as it flies back to the only other man worthy enough to wield it...STEVE ROGERS. Half-conscious, THOR SEES STEVE HOLDING MJOLNIR.
C: THOR
D: I...knew...it...
N: STEVE ATTACKS, CRACKING THANOS IN THE JAW. THANOS TUMBLES. BEFORE THE TITAN CAN GET UP, STEVE CALLS DOWN THE LIGHTNING AND SENDS IT CRACKLING INTO THANOS’ BODY. Steve leaps, trying to finish Thanos off...BUT THANOS ROLLS ASIDE, HEAD-BUTTING STEVE BACKWARDS.
S: THANOS GETS TO HIS FEET, A FAINT SMILE ON HIS FACE.
N: HE WHIPS OFF HIS HELMET AND ATTACKS STEVE WITH HIS BLADE. BLOW AFTER BLOW. IT’S ALL STEVE CAN DO TO GET HIS SHIELD UP. THANOS HACKS THE SHIELD TO PIECES, FINALLY KNOCKING STEVE ACROSS THE FIELD. Steve lies beaten, half a shield still attached to his arm.
C: THANOS
D: In all my years of conquest...
N: Thanos looks out at the tiny human struggling to stand.
C: THANOS
D: Of violence and slaughter...it was never personal.
E: CONT'D
N: Thanos gestures behind him as A RUMBLE ECHOES. THOUSANDS OF ALIENS RING THE LIP OF THE CRATER: THE BLACK ORDER LEADS A PLATOON OF CHITAURI, SAKAARANS, AND OUTRIDERS.
C: THANOS
D: But I’ll tell you now, the things I’m about to do to your stubborn, annoying, little planet...
E: CONT'D
N: Q-SHIPS, DROPSHIPS, NECROCRAFT, AND LEVIATHANS BUZZ ABOVE.
C: THANOS
D: I’m going to enjoy it. Very, very much.
E: CONT'D
N: Steve stares at Thanos and his army. And even in the face of such overwhelming odds...he gets to his feet. THANOS stares, almost sad, as Steve tightens the broken shield on his arm...AND STARTS WALKING TOWARD HIM. One man against thousands. All alone. But just then, Steve’s COM CRACKLES. He strains to hear. The com crackles again. We can make out A MUFFLED VOICE.
C: MUFFLED VOICE
D: -ap-...-comin-...-ot-
E: ON COM
N: Steve shakes his head, trying to clear it. Slowly, SOUND RETURNS...AND THE WORDS RING CLEAR:
C: SAM WILSON
D: Cap. On your left.
E: O.S.
N: PULL BACK...TO SEE A PORTAL OPENING IN THE DISTANCE. OUT OF
C: IT FLIES...SAM WILSON.
D: 124
N: Steve watches Sam soar over the field, then turns AS EVEN MORE PORTALS OPEN. FROM ONE: DR. STRANGE, PETER QUILL, DRAX, MANTIS, PETER PARKER...AND KRAGLIN AND THE RAVAGERS. FROM ANOTHER: T’CHALLA, OKOYE, SHURI, M’BAKU, WANDA, BUCKY, GROOT...AND THE WAKANDAN ARMY. FROM A THIRD: VALKYRIE, KORG, MIEK...AND AN ASGARDIAN ARMY. FROM A FOURTH: PEPPER POTTS (IN RESCUE ARMOR), HOPE VAN DYNE, AND WONG LEADING A SQUAD OF SORCERERS. THOR gets to his feet, calling Stormbreaker to his hand as...TONY regains consciousness, staring out at the cavalry. Wong and Strange quickly find each other.
C: DR. STRANGE
D: Is that everyone?
C: WONG
D: You wanted more?!
N: JUST THEN, THE GROUND SHAKES AND RUBBLE EXPLODES UPWARDS AS...GIANT-MAN BURSTS FROM BELOW.
C: SCOTT LANG
D: Top floor, everybody out!
N: HE OPENS HIS HUGE HAND, RELEASING ROCKET, SMART HULK, AND RHODEY, NOW IN HIS COSMIC IRON PATRIOT ARMOR. STEVE TAKES IN HIS REINFORCEMENTS, THEN STARES OUT AT THANOS. PAN ACROSS OUR HEROES AS STEVE CALLS MJOLNIR TO HIS HAND.
C: STEVE
D: Avengers...assemble.
N: THOR LETS LOOSE A BATTLE CRY AS HE CHARGES! EVERYONE FOLLOWS SUIT AS OUR HEROES FLOOD THE FIELD. ACROSS THE WAY, THANOS SMILES AND POINTS HIS BLADE. TWO MIGHTY ARMIES RACE TOWARD EACH OTHER UNTIL...CLASH! GIANT-MAN SLUGS A LEVIATHAN IN THE JAW. DRAX launches himself onto a CULL currently choking the life
C: out of KORG.
D: 125
N: TONY blasts overhead. RESCUE joins him. Together, they strafe the field. STEVE and THOR fight together. Both hold out their hands. Stormbreaker returns to Steve, Mjolnir to Thor, who frowns.
C: THOR
D: No. You take the little one.
N: Elsewhere, TONY BATTLES SEVERAL CULLS. One knocks him into an Outrider, who’s about to rip his armor off when... THWIP. PETER PARKER webs the Outrider, yanking him into the path of...GIANT-MAN’S FOOT. SQUISH. Tony stares at Peter, emotional. They retract their helmets.
C: PETER PARKER
D: Mr. Stark. Holy cow, you would not believe what’s been going on. Do you remember when we were in space? And I got all dusty? I must’ve passed out, because I woke up and you weren’t there, but Dr. Strange was, and he was like, “it’s been five years, they need us.” And he started doing that yellow sparkly thing he does-
N: But Tony just wraps his arms around him, smashing Peter’s face into his chest plate.
C: PETER PARKER
D: Oh. This is nice.
E: CONT'D muffled
N: ACROSS THE FIELD...QUILL flies, firing down on Sakaaran soldiers. One leaps off an outcropping... TACKLING QUILL INTO A WRECKED FUSELAGE, WHERE ANOTHER SAKAARAN WAITS. Quill drops one, but the other raises his weapon to strike. THEN BLAM! The Sakaaran drops dead on top of Quill. He pushes the body off to see...GAMORA, BLASTER STILL SMOKING. Quill stares, amazed.
C: QUILL
D: Gamora?
C: HE APPROACHES, OVERWHELMED, EMOTIONAL.
D: 126
C: QUILL
D: I thought I lost you.
E: CONT'D
N: He tenderly strokes her face...and she knees him in the nuts. Twice. He goes down, gasping.
C: QUILL
D: You missed the first time...then you got ‘em both the second time.
E: CONT'D
N: She stares down at him as...NEBULA JOINS HER.
C: GAMORA
D: This is the one? Seriously?
C: NEBULA
D: Your choices were him or a tree.
S: ACROSS THE FIELD...CLINT RUNS WITH THE GAUNTLET, PURSUED BY A
N: CHITAURI APE. Just before the ape tramples Clint... SAM WILSON SWOOPS IN, CUTTING THE CREATURE DOWN. Clint runs on. The heroes confer over coms.
S: CLINT BARTON
N: What do you want to do with this thing?
C: STEVE
D: Get those stones as far away as possible!
C: SMART HULK
D: No! We need to send them back where they came from.
C: TONY
D: There’s no way to send them back. Thanos destroyed our time machine.
C: SCOTT LANG
D: Hold on! That wasn’t our only time machine.
E: shrinking to normal size
N: He clicks the KEYS TO LUIS’ VAN. From a distance, we hear, “LA CUCARACHA.” Steve immediately gets it.
C: STEVE
D: Does anyone see an ugly, brown van out there?
N: ABOVE, VALKYRIE SCANS THE FIELD FROM HER PEGASUS.
C: VALKYRIE
D: Yeah. But you’re not going to like where it’s parked.
N: LUIS’ VAN SITS SURROUNDED BY THOUSANDS OF ALIENS, DEEP BEHIND ENEMY LINES. STEVE SURVEYS THE FIELD: AN ARMY STANDS BETWEEN THEM AND THE VAN, AIR AND GROUND CHOKED WITH ENEMIES.
C: TONY
D: Scott, how long do you need to get that thing working?
E: INTO COM
C: SCOTT LANG
D: Uh, maybe ten minutes.
C: STEVE
D: Get it started. We’ll get the stones to you.
C: HOPE VAN DYNE
D: We’re on it, Cap.
N: SCOTT glances at her. Cap? THEY SHRINK DOWN AND FLY AWAY. TONY FLIES UP TO DR. STRANGE, HOVERING.
C: TONY
D: Doc. You said we win one in 14 million. Is this how it goes down?
C: DR. STRANGE
D: If I tell you what happens, it won’t happen.
C: TONY
D: You better be right.
N: Tony rockets away. Strange coolly watches him go. ACROSS THE FIELD...EBONY MAW RUSHES TO THANOS.
C: EBONY MAW
D: Sire, the stones!
S: THANOS TURNS TO SEE...CLINT FIGHTING THROUGH THE HORDE,
N: CARRYING THE GAUNTLET. A CULL HAMMERS CLINT, BUT THEN...T’CHALLA SLASHES THE CULL.
C: T’CHALLA
D: Clint, give it to me. 128
S: CLINT HANDS THE GAUNTLET TO T’CHALLA, WHO TUCKS IT AND RUNS.
N: ACROSS THE FIELD...SCOTT AND HOPE FLY OVER A LONG PLATOON OF CHITAURI, TOWARD LUIS’ VAN.
S: INT./EXT LUIS’ VAN - CONTINUOUS
N: They GROW TO NORMAL SIZE in the front seat. Out the windshield, THANOS’ HORDE CHARGES AT THEIR FRIENDS.
C: SCOTT LANG
D: Ignition’s broken. I’ll hotwire it-
E: digging around
C: HOPE VAN DYNE
D: Wait, you know how to do that?
N: Scott splices wires. Sparks fly.
C: SCOTT LANG
D: I was in prison. I know how to do a lot of things.
S: EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, CRATER - DAY
N: T’CHALLA RACES THROUGH THE HORDE...BUT THEN THANOS KNOCKS HIM OFF HIS FEET. THE GAUNTLET GOES TUMBLING. AS THANOS MOVES IN ON T’CHALLA...ALL AROUND, WRECKAGE BEGINS TO FLOAT. THANOS LOOKS UP TO SEE... WANDA, HOVERING IN THE AIR, WAITING FOR HIM.
C: WANDA
D: You took everything from me.
N: Thanos takes THE BLADE off his back.
C: THANOS
D: I don’t even know who you are.
C: WANDA
D: You will.
N: WANDA UNLEASHES A STORM OF RED ENERGY, HURLING WRECKAGE AT HIM. AS THANOS FIGHTS HIS WAY THROUGH IT... T’CHALLA DIVES FOR THE FALLEN GAUNTLET. SUDDENLY...EBONY MAW MANIPULATES THE EARTH, PULLING THE GAUNTLET TOWARD HIM. T’CHALLA WRAPS HIMSELF AROUND THE GLOVE, GETTING DRAGGED.
C: PETER PARKER
D: I GOT IT!
E: O.S.
N: T’CHALLA TURNS TO SEE PETER WHIZZING PAST. HE HURLS THE GAUNTLET...THWIP! Peter snatches it out of the air. HE LANDS, ONLY TO FIND HIMSELF SURROUNDED BY OUTRIDERS.
C: PETER PARKER
D: Activate instant kill!
E: CONT'D
N: His robotic arms slash with expert precision. ACROSS THE FIELD...WANDA LIFTS THANOS INTO THE AIR, RIPS HIS ARMOR OFF IN PIECES, THEN SLAMS HIM BACK TO THE GROUND. Thanos groans, outmatched.
C: THANOS
D: Rain fire. Wipe them all out.
E: INTO COM
N: CORVUS GLAIVE FIGHTS GROOT.
C: CORVUS GLAIVE
D: But, sire, our troops-
C: THANOS
D: Just do it!
E: INTO COM
N: HIGH ABOVE...THE SANCTUARY-2 DESCENDS, CANNONS OPENING UP. BELOW...WANDA looks up, raising a force field just as... THE SANCTUARY-2 FIRES DOWN WITH EVERYTHING IT HAS. SAKAARANS AND JABARI ALIKE GO FLYING AS EVERY SQUARE INCH GETS HIT. THE BARRAGE HAMMERS THE RIVERBANK. CRACKS FORM. PEPPER CUTS DOWN AN ALIEN, THEN SPOTS SOMETHING OFF SCREEN.
C: PEPPER POTTS
D: Um, is anyone else seeing this?
E: INTO COM
N: TONY, SMART HULK, AND GAMORA turn to see...WATER GUSHING AS THE RIVERBANK THREATENS TO COLLAPSE. SUDDENLY... STRANGE AND WONG CONJURE TWO HUGE RUNE SHIELDS TO SHORE UP THE BANK. MORE WIZARDS JOIN, CREATING A HUGE “RUNE LEVEE.” THE SANCTUARY-2 MAINTAINS ITS BARRAGE. ACROSS THE FIELD...STEVE spots PETER PARKER gradually being overwhelmed by Outriders.
C: PETER PARKER
D: I got this...I got this...I don’t got this.
C: STEVE
D: Hey, Queens! Heads up!
N: STEVE HURLS MJOLNIR OVER THE THRONG. PETER WEBS ON...LETTING THE HAMMER PULL HIM OUT OF DANGER. A MORTAR BLAST KNOCKS HIM OUT OF THE SKY, BUT PEPPER POTTS RESCUES HIM.
C: PEPPER POTTS
D: Hang on, kid. I’ve got you.
N: She drags him above the fray, then tosses him to...VALKYRIE FLYING PAST. PETER PERCHES ATOP PEGASUS.
C: PETER PARKER
D: Hey, nice to meet you-aaaaarg!
N: VALKYRIE SPURS INTO HIGH GEAR, DODGING CANNON FIRE... BUT NOT FAST ENOUGH. A BLAST KNOCKS PETER TO THE GROUND. HE GASPS, COVERED IN DEBRIS, STILL CLUTCHING THE GAUNTLET. ALL AROUND THE FIELD, THE RELENTLESS BARRAGE PINS DOWN OUR HEROES. ALL HOPE IS LOST. Rocket and Groot dive for cover. Groot wraps his branches around them both.
C: ROCKET
D: At least we’re going out together this time...
N: SUDDENLY, EVERYTHING GOES SILENT. ROCKET PEERS OUT FROM COVER TO SEE...THE CANNONS SWIVELING UP TOWARD THE CLOUDS. SAM WILSON flies overhead.
C: SAM WILSON
D: What the hell is this?
N: TONY’S HUD: TONY FLIES OVERHEAD, SEARCHING UPWARD.
C: TONY
D: Friday, what are they firing at?
C: FRIDAY
D: Something just entered the upper atmosphere. 131
E: O.S.
N: Rocket looks up at...A COMET HEADING STRAIGHT FOR EARTH.
C: GROOT
D: I am Groot.
E: nervous
N: Rocket grins, knowing what’s coming.
C: ROCKET
D: Just wait for it.
N: SUDDENLY, THE COMET VEERS...RIGHT TOWARD THE SHIP. BOOM! THE COMET TEARS THROUGH THE SANCTUARY-2, RIGHT OUT THE OTHER SIDE, REVEALING...CAROL DANVERS.
C: ROCKET
D: Oh, yeah!
E: CONT'D
N: CAROL GLOWS BRIGHTER AS SHE GOES BINARY, ROCKETING AGAIN THROUGH THE HULL. BOOM! THE SHIP LISTS, ENGINES EXPLODING. CAROL EYES THE BATTLEFIELD, EXHAUSTED, LIGHT FADING.
C: STEVE
D: Danvers! We’re gonna need an assist down here!
E: OVER COM
C: CAROL DANVERS
D: Roger...Rogers...
E: INTO COM under ragged breath
S: INT. VAN - DAY
N: Scott twists wires on the Quantum Tunnel, hotwiring it.
C: SCOTT LANG
D: I’m almost there. Where’s the glove?
E: INTO COM
S: EXT. CRATER - DAY
N: CAROL LANDS IN FRONT OF A DAZED PETER PARKER, WHO STILL HOLDS THE GAUNTLET TIGHT. HE LOOKS UP, CONFUSED.
C: PETER PARKER
D: Uh, hey. I’m Peter Parker.
C: CAROL DANVERS
D: Hey, Peter Parker. You got something for me? 132
N: Peter hands it over, staring out at the approaching horde.
C: PETER PARKER
D: I don’t know how you’re gonna get it through all that-
C: WANDA
D: Don’t worry, kid...
E: O.S.
N: Peter turns to see... WANDA, OKOYE, GAMORA, NEBULA, VALKYRIE, HOPE, AND SHURI WAITING. Wanda’s hands begin to glow.
C: OKOYE
D: She’s got help.
N: Carol glances at PEPPER and MANTIS, then tucks the gauntlet under her arm AND LEADS THEM OUT. AT THE RIDGE...Thanos spots THE WOMEN OF MARVEL BLASTING THROUGH HIS TROOPS. HE TRACKS THEIR PATH TO...THE VAN. SCOTT KICKS THE REAR DOORS OPEN, EXPOSING THE QUANTUM TUNNEL.
C: SCOTT LANG
D: Thirty seconds!
N: Thanos understands immediately. HE GRABS PROXIMA’S SPEAR FROM HER, AND STARTS RUNNING... ACROSS THE FIELD...EBONY MAW SENDS WANDA TUMBLING, BUT SHURI BLASTS HIM OUT OF THE SKY. CULL OBSIDIAN HAMMERS VALKYRIE, BUT NEBULA TAKES HIM OUT. CAROL KEEPS GOING, GAUNTLET TUCKED UNDER HER ARM, GETTING CLOSER AND CLOSER TO... THE VAN...WHERE THE QUANTUM TUNNEL BURSTS TO LIFE. ACROSS THE FIELD...GROUNDED HEROES LOOK UP TO SEE CAROL NOW JUST YARDS AWAY FROM THE GOAL. SHE PUTS HER HEAD DOWN, FLYING FOR ALL SHE’S WORTH. BUT JUST AS SHE REACHES THE GAPING VAN DOORS... THANOS THROWS THE SPEAR... BOOM! THE VAN EXPLODES, SENDING SCOTT AND CAROL FLYING, TAKING OUT SOME OF THE WIZARDS HOLDING BACK THE RIVER. THANOS CATCHES PROXIMA’S RETURNING SPEAR. TIME SLOWS AS...STEVE, THOR, AND TONY SPOT...THE GAUNTLET, LYING UNGUARDED IN THE DIRT. The problem is...SO DOES THANOS. TIME RESUMES AS...THEY ALL SCRAMBLE FOR THE STONES. THEY COLLIDE. THANOS SNATCHES UP THE GAUNTLET, KICKING THOR DOWN. THANOS KNOCKS TONY ASIDE, THEN SQUEEZES THE CRUSHED GAUNTLET, POPPING IT OPEN...JUST WIDE ENOUGH TO PUT HIS HAND INSIDE. STEVE LUNGES, BUT THANOS THROTTLES HIM. FINALLY CLEAR, THANOS SLIPS ON THE GAUNTLET. BUT BEFORE HE CAN SNAP... CAROL ARRIVES. SHE GRABS THE GLOVE, PREVENTING HIM FROM CLOSING HIS FIST. HE HEADBUTTS HER...BUT SHE DOESN’T MOVE. CAROL PRESSES THANOS DOWN, BUT BEFORE HE FALLS... THANOS PULLS THE POWER STONE FROM ITS HOUSING AND PUNCHES CAROL, SENDING HER FLYING. THE FIELD GOES QUIET. NOW, NOTHING STANDS IN THANOS’ WAY. Tony gets to his knees, realizing... The Avengers are going to lose. ACROSS THE FIELD...WATER STARTS TO SPILL INTO THE CRATER. STRANGE TRIES TO HOLD IT BACK...BUT IT’S A LOSING BATTLE. He looks to Tony... Tony meets his eye. And in that moment, all Strange can do is hold up a single finger. “One.” ACROSS THE FIELD...THANOS RETURNS THE POWER STONE TO THE GAUNTLET. JUST AS THE ENERGY SURGES THROUGH HIM... TONY LUNGES FOR THE GAUNTLET IN THANOS’ HAND, NANO-CLAMPING IT IN A VISE. THANOS KNOCKS HIM ASIDE. HE LIFTS HIS HAND IN THE AIR, TRIUMPHANT.
C: THANOS
D: I am...inevitable.
N: THANOS SNAPS HIS FINGERS. But nothing happens. Confused, Thanos turns the glove over to find...THE STONES ARE GONE. He looks to see...TONY, NANO-PARTICLES SLIDING AND SHIFTING, FORMING A NEW GAUNTLET ON HIS OWN WRIST: COMPLETE WITH SIX INFINITY STONES. POWER SURGES THROUGH TONY, EXCRUCIATING, BUT HE STILL LIFTS HIS HAND...
C: TONY
D: And I...am Iron Man.
N: SNAP! WHOOSH. THE TIDAL WAVE EVAPORATES INTO MIST. ALL AROUND THE FIELD, SAKAARANS AND OUTRIDERS FOLD IN ON THEMSELVES, ATOMS DISINTEGRATING. THANOS LOOKS AROUND, WATCHING HIS TROOPS DISAPPEAR. SHIPS VANISH FROM THE SKY. CULLS, CHITAURI, ALL BLOW AWAY... LEAVING THANOS STANDING ALONE. AFTER A LONG MOMENT, HE SITS DOWN ON A ROCK...AND ACCEPTS HIS FATE. He watches as... HIS ATOMS DISSOLVE. FINALLY, THANOS DISAPPEARS. ACROSS THE FIELD, QUILL turns to GAMORA...BUT FINDS HER GONE.
C: QUILL
D: Babe? Gamora?
N: ACROSS THE FIELD...TONY STARK FALLS BACK AGAINST THE UPTURNED ROOTS OF A TREE, ARMOR SMOKING, ARM WITHERED AND BLACKENED. Dying. RHODEY RUSHES TO HIM, BUT WITH ONE LOOK, HE KNOWS IT’S TOO LATE. TONY EXHALES, ALMOST LETTING GO. Then... PETER PARKER lands, kneeling, taking Tony’s hand.
C: PETER PARKER
D: Mr. Stark...Tony...it’s okay, it’s okay...Mr. Stark, we won. You did it, sir...
N: But Tony gazes past him. Rhodey puts his hand on Peter’s shoulder, guiding him away... AS PEPPER ARRIVES. She kneels, heartsick.
C: PEPPER POTTS
D: Hey, Friday, what’ve we got?
C: FRIDAY
D: Life functions critical.
E: O.S.
N: Pepper stares into her husband’s eyes...and knows.
C: PEPPER POTTS
D: Tony, look at me. We’re going to be okay...
N: He stares at her, tears welling. I’m sorry. She touches his face, then leans in to kiss him.
C: PEPPER POTTS
D: You can rest now.
E: CONT'D
N: When she pulls back, she sees his eyes, fixed and glassy. Everything goes quiet. All around, OUR HEROES GATHER, the full weight of what’s happened dawning on them. Tony Stark is gone.
T: FADE TO BLACK.
S: EXT. HIGH SCHOOL NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT
N: PETER PARKER enters a hallway teeming with students. He searches the crowd, finally finding...NED LEEDS. As they embrace...
S: EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - NIGHT
N: Fireworks explode over the skyline of San Francisco.
C: TONY
D: Everybody wants a happy ending. But it doesn’t always roll that way. Maybe this time.
E: O.S.
N: On Cassie’s porch, SCOTT watches with HOPE and CASSIE, all of them grinning.
S: EXT. BARTON HOME, FRONT PORCH - DAY
N: TWO BIKES lean on the porch of THE BARTON FARM HOUSE. Then the front door opens...and COOPER and LILA BARTON step out.
C: TONY
D: I’m hoping if you play this back, it’s in celebration. 136
E: O.S. MORE
C: TONY
D: I hope families are reunited, I hope we get it back and something like a normal version of the planet has been restored. If there ever was such a thing.
E: O.S. CONT'D
N: She looks up at...A QUINJET descending from the sky.
S: EXT. WAKANDA - SUNSET
N: ON THE PALACE BALCONY...T’CHALLA embraces his mother, RAMONDA. Shuri turns from them to the magnificent sunset.
C: TONY
D: God, what a world. Universe, now. If you’d told me ten years ago that we weren’t alone, let alone to this extent, I probably wouldn’t have been surprised. But come on...
E: O.S.
S: EXT BARTON HOME - DAY
N: The Quinjet touches down. The rear jump door opens, revealing CLINT. He stares at Lila and Cooper, overwhelmed.
C: TONY
D: Who knew what epic forces of dark and light would come into play? For better or worse, that’s the reality our children get to grow up in.
E: O.S.
N: They throw themselves into his arms. He kisses their heads, tears in his eyes. Finally, he looks up to see... LAURA BARTON, beaming, tearful, holding THREE YEAR-OLD NATHANIEL’S HAND. Clint gathers them all into a hug.
S: INT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: A HOLOGRAM of TONY STARK projects from an IRON MAN HELMET on the table.
C: TONY
D: That’s why I thought I’d probably better record a little greeting, in the case of…an untimely death on my part. 137
E: O.S. MORE
C: TONY
D: I mean, death at any time is untimely, but...this “time travel” thing we’re going to try to pull off tomorrow has me scratching my head about the “survivability” of it all. But that’s the hero gig, right? Part of the journey is the end.
E: O.S. CONT'D
N: REVERSE to find PEPPER, MORGAN, HAPPY HOGAN, RHODEY, THOR, STEVE, SMART HULK, and CLINT, all dressed in black, watching.
C: TONY
D: What am I even tripping for? Everything is going to work out exactly the way it’s supposed to.
E: CONT'D
N: HOLO TONY seems to look out at the gathered heroes...and Morgan in particular.
C: TONY
D: I love you 3000.
E: CONT'D
N: He switches off the camera, vanishing. Tears streaming, Pepper kisses Morgan’s forehead.
S: EXT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, BACK STAIRS - DAY
N: PEPPER and MORGAN slowly descend the stairs, carrying an RT RINGED WITH FLOWERS. The Avengers follow, somber.
S: EXT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, LAKESIDE - DAY
N: PEPPER RESTS THE FLOWERS ON THE WATER. CLOSE ON THE RT: “Proof That Tony Stark Has A Heart.” Pull back, past Morgan and HAPPY HOGAN... PAST STEVE, SAM, RHODEY, AND WANDA...

PAST MARIA HILL, CAROL DANVERS, and, finally, NICK FURY. THE MOURNERS MOVE TO THE EDGE OF THE LAKE.
S: EXT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, LAKESIDE - DAY
N: LATER...CLINT looks out at the lake. WANDA approaches.
S: CLINT BARTON
N: I just wish there were some way I could let her know that we won. That we did it.
C: WANDA
D: She knows. They both do.
N: Clint puts his arm around her. They stare out at the water.
S: EXT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, PORCH/BACK STAIRS- DAY
N: ON THE PORCH, HAPPY HOGAN HOLDS MORGAN’S HAND.
C: HAPPY HOGAN
D: How are you doing, squirt? You hungry?
C: MORGAN STARK
D: Uh, huh.
C: HAPPY HOGAN
D: What do you want?
C: MORGAN STARK
D: Cheeseburgers?
N: Happy takes a beat, choked up. Like father like daughter.
C: HAPPY HOGAN
D: Did you know your dad liked cheeseburgers?

C: VALKYRIE
D: So when can we expect you back?
C: THOR
D: About that...
C: VALKYRIE
D: Thor, your people need a king.
C: THOR
D: They already have one. And she’s a far better king than I could ever be.
C: VALKYRIE
D: Are you serious?
C: THOR
D: It’s time to be who I am, rather than who I’m supposed to be. And a leader is who you are.
N: She processes this. Does she want it? She does.
C: VALKYRIE
D: You know, I’d make a lot of changes around here.
C: THOR
D: I’m counting on it, Your Majesty.
N: Emotional, Val finally SHAKES HIS HAND.
C: VALKYRIE
D: What will you do?
C: THOR
D: I’m not entirely sure. For the first time in a thousand years, I have no path. But I do have a ride.
E: beat

N: He settles beside Quill, who holomaps their course.
C: THOR
D: All right, where first?
E: CONT'D
N: He swipes through images on the screen.
C: QUILL
D: You know, I’m still in charge, here, right?
C: THOR
D: Of course. Of course...
N: Thor swipes the map again.
C: QUILL
D: See, when you keep swiping my map, that sounds kind of like, “of course, I know you think you’re still in charge-”
C: THOR
D: Quail, that’s your own insecurities bubbling up.
C: DRAX
D: You should fight one another for the honor of leadership.
C: NEBULA
D: Sounds fair.
C: QUILL
D: That’s not necessary...
C: ROCKET
D: I’ve got some blasters right here. Unless you want to use knives. 141
C: MANTIS
D: Oh, yes, please, use knives-
C: QUILL
D: No one’s using knives!
C: GROOT
D: I am Groot!
N: Quill and Thor exchange nervous laughter.
C: THOR
D: There’ll be no knifing young Quail today. Everyone knows who’s in charge.
N: A long awkward moment passes.

D: Me. Right?
E: sotto, to Thor
N: Thor just smiles...
S: EXT. NEW ASGARD, HILLSIDE - DAY
N: The ship rises. WHOOSH. IT MAKES THE JUMP AND DISAPPEARS.
S: EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, RUINS - DAY
N: CONSTRUCTION CREWS REMOVE RUBBLE FROM AVENGERS COMPOUND. A COMMAND TENT stands in a clearing beside... A NEW QUANTUM TUNNEL (3.0). As STEVE, SAM, and BUCKY wait, SMART HULK makes last minute adjustments. He finally opens A CASE: THE SIX INFINITY STONES GLOW INSIDE.
C: SMART HULK
D: Remember, you’ll have to return the stones to the exact moment they were taken. Otherwise, we’re still looking at a whole bunch of nasty alternate realities.
C: STEVE
D: Got it. I’ll clip all the branches. 142
N: Steve takes the case.
C: SMART HULK
D: You know, I tried. When I had the gauntlet. I really tried to bring her back. I miss her.

D: Me, too.
C: SMART HULK
D: You’d better get going. We’re almost ready for you.
N: Steve and Sam approach the platform.
C: SAM WILSON
D: You look a little nervous going by yourself. Ask nicely, I’ll go with you.
C: STEVE
D: You’re a good man, Sam. But this one’s on me.
N: When Steve reaches the platform, BUCKY stops him, pointed.
C: STEVE
D: Don’t do anything stupid ‘til I get back, okay?
E: CONT'D
C: BUCKY BARNES
D: How can I? You’re taking all the stupid with you.

D: Gonna miss you, buddy.
E: CONT'D
C: STEVE
D: It’s going to be okay, Buck.
N: Steve picks up Mjolnir and takes his place on the platform. SAM LOOKS TO SMART HULK AT THE CONSOLE.
C: SAM WILSON
D: How long’s this gonna take? 143
C: SMART HULK
D: For him, as long as he needs. For us, five seconds. Ready, Cap? You’re good to go. Meet you right back here, okay?
E: calling out
N: Steve glances at Bucky as he answers.
C: STEVE
D: You bet.
C: SMART HULK

C: SMART HULK
D: Aaand, returning in five... four...three...two...one-
E: CONT'D
N: Silence. Nothing happens.
C: SAM WILSON
D: Where is he?
C: SMART HULK
D: I don’t know. He blew past our time stamp. He should be here.
C: SAM WILSON
D: Get him back!
C: SMART HULK
D: I’m trying.
C: SAM WILSON
D: Get him the hell back-
C: SMART HULK
D: I’M TRYING!
N: Just then...Bucky looks out to the water.
C: BUCKY BARNES
D: Sam.
N: Sam turns...
S: EXT AVENGERS COMPOUND, RIVERBANK - CONTINUOUS
N: Work crews have cleared a space overlooking the river. There, AN OLD MAN sits on a bench, staring out at the Hudson. Move around him to find SAM watching from A FEW YARDS AWAY.
C: SAM WILSON
D: Hey, Cap.
N: The man turns and we now see: STEVE ROGERS, age 112.
C: OLD STEVE
D: Hi, Sam.
C: SAM WILSON
D: Something go wrong...or something go right?
C: OLD STEVE
D: I thought, after everything that’s happened...maybe I should try out some of that life Tony always told me to get.
C: SAM WILSON
D: How was it?
N: Steve looks at the river, 112 years of emotion in his face.
C: OLD STEVE
D: It was beautiful.
C: SAM WILSON
D: I’m happy for you. Really.
C: OLD STEVE
D: Thanks.
C: SAM WILSON
D: Only thing bumming me out is now I live in a world without Captain America.
N: Steve pulls up A CASE from beside him, giving it to Sam.
C: OLD STEVE
D: That’s kind of why I’m here.
N: Sam unzips it, revealing...A BRAND NEW SHIELD.
C: SAM WILSON
D: Where did you even get this?
C: OLD STEVE
D: I had a little time to travel. Try it on. 145
E: beat
N: Sam hesitates. He glances back at Bucky, who nods. Then Sam picks up the shield...and puts it on.
C: OLD STEVE
D: How does it feel?
E: CONT'D
C: SAM WILSON
D: Like it’s someone else’s.
C: OLD STEVE
D: It isn’t.
N: Sam tries to check his emotion. He shakes Steve’s hand.
C: SAM WILSON
D: Thank you. I’ll try my best.
N: Steve rests his other hand on Sam’s.
C: OLD STEVE
D: That’s why it’s yours.
N: Sam smiles, noticing...STEVE’S TARNISHED WEDDING RING.
