N: The westbound car cuts sharply and drives up on the sidewalk. But Bourne is too fast. He's already past them. The passenger side agent jumps out. But he's still got to get around the door and then move a few steps to get a bead over the hood of his car on Bourne.

He surveys every aspect of his environment on the fly (which includes his taking a quick peak over the concrete railing at the east end of the roof. Next Bourne rushes toward the parked cars. Smashes the window of one to set off its alarm. Then a second and a third, setting off their alarms. The fourth window Bourne smashes in doesn't set off an alarm. Bourne pulls the door open and climbs in. Inside the car Bourne reaches under the dash and yanks handful of wires off the steering column and starts to expertly hotwire the car.

S: EXT. ROOFTOP PARKING LOT -- PORT AUTHORITY
N: Bourne works to hotwire the car. A CRI car gets to the roof. Two agents come from the elevator lobby. The three car alarms distract them. They search for Bourne, but can't find him at first... Bourne gets the car engine on - but, given the wonders of modern anti-theft technology his steering wheel is still locked. A second CRI car arrives. Bourne slams the car into low gear and backs up at high speed. He smashes into the car across the aisle from him. With a sharp metallic snap the wheel in Bourne's car is suddenly free, he jams the car into drive pulls out into lane and stops. Three CRI cars here now. Two head straight for him. A third blocks the exit ramp. Bourne checks the rearview and sees two more agents pour from the elevator lobby, one carrying the serious firepower of an M-4 (an M-16 variant whose bullets can penetrate metal and concrete). They move into position to get a bead on him. Bourne assesses. But he doesn't move. The agents swarm toward him. What the hell is he doing? Why is he waiting?

N: The agents clear their obstructions and drop their barrels toward Bourne-- But before they can get a bead-- Bourne slams the car into reverse again. Petal to the metal in reverse-- The agents open fire. Bourne ducks the lead slugs ripping through the windshield. But there's no dodging the shower of broken glass. As Bourne disappears below the dashboard, the CRI agent adjusts his fire into the car's grill. Virtually blind, Bourne races the hard-pressed vehicle backwards as the agent's fire decimates the car's driveline. Bourne slips the car into neutral and takes a quick peek behind him. Steers still speeding but quickly dying car towards a small gap between two parked cars at the edge of the parking structure. Bourne's car splits the gap between the parked cars, hits the base of a low angled wall that slams the back of his car up and over the wall. Bourne is pounded as his car jounces onto the wall, a second later the front end seesaws over the top, the sudden angle change exposes for an instant the bottom of Bourne's car, to the shooters. Several rounds rip through the floorboard and tear past Bourne's head just before his car drops upside down for 25 feet and slams onto a row of parked cars. The impact rips Bourne from the seat and slams him hard against the roof. Bourne struggles out of the car, knowing he has only a moment before the armed agents will fire down into his over- turned car.

N: Two CRI cars race down from the roof to try to get to the level Bourne's on.
S: 275 INT./EXT. PARKING GARAGE -- TWO LEVELS BELOW ROOFTOP 275
N: Bourne cuts off a guy cruising for a parking space and pulls him from his car and races away as the agent from the roof lands hard behind him. Bourne's race to the exit is cut off as a 3rd CRI sedan slides into view and it's occupants open fire on Bourne in a head on charge. The just stolen vehicle takes heavy fire as Bourne reacts instantaneously; thumbing on the cruise control, shouldering his door open, and slamming the gas pedal to the floor as he dives out of the car. The agents react as Bourne's sedan torpedoes them head on. Hit hard they're taken out of the fight as metal collapses, glass shatters, and airbags explode. Bourne tumbles to a stop at the rear of a parked car as his car implodes against the oncoming agents. Instantly Bourne is on his feet, moving between the parked cars to engage another CRI sedan traveling parallel to the course of the wrecked one. The agents in this sedan are distracted by the still echoing crash and are caught off-guard as Bourne steps out and points his gun at the driver. The driver ducks and floors his gas pedal in a desperate effort to save his own life. As the sedan suddenly accelerates, Bourne deliberately shifts his aim to the sedan's front tire and fires. The tire explodes and the car suddenly veers left and slams into a parked car, pitching the driver violently against the unyielding interior of the sedan. An instant later Bourne rips the radio off the dazed drivers belt just before he cold cocks him with it. With the wreck still echoing through the garage Bourne has to deal with the arrival of the first NYPD sedan. Bourne takes on the persona of an alarmed witness as the on edge cop climbs out of his car but Bourne's performance is cut short as the agent running from his drop from the roof, arrives and opens fire. The police officer goes down in the hail of gunfire as Bourne turns and expertly drops the gunman with a single shot. The increasing volume of squealing tires alerts Bourne to a new threat, he pulls the officer into some cover and grabs the officer's radio.
C: BOURNE
D: 10-13. Shots fired. Officer down. Port Authority parking lot. Level four.
N: Bourne rips a piece of his sweater off and ties a makeshift tourniquet for the officer. Then he hands the cop his radio back.
C: BOURNE
D: Stay out of sight until one of your own arrive.
E: CONT'D
N: Bourne disappears. We pick him up as he jumps into the cops car and guns the engine and heads for the exits. CRI agents are confused for a second -- until they pick up the NYPD car exiting Port Authority on one of the ramps. But that's all the time Bourne needs-- 276 OMITTED 276
S: 277 EXT. CROSSTOWN STREET -- DAY 277
N: Bourne turns on his lights and siren and speeds east, followed closely by a CRI sedan. As cars yield to Bourne's siren a taxi tries to jump into Bourne's wake but a CRI sedan punches the taxi back to the right. It ricochets off several parked cars before regaining control. 277A OMITTED 277A 280 OMITTED 280
S: 281 EXT. CROSSTOWN STREET -- DAY 281
N: Bourne struggles to keep his over-matched vehicle ahead of the more powerful CRI Sedan which tries to spin Bourne out by hitting his bumper. Bourne tacks right quickly and barely avoids a stopped car. The CRI sedan flanking Bourne's slams into the rear of that car, spinning it 180 degrees into the path of the trailing CRI sedan which destroys itself in the resulting collision and blocks the path of the other CRI sedan.
S: 282 INT. BOURNE'S CAR -- DAY 282
N: Bourne is home free. He looks around and spots a sign that indicates a right turn and says "To Holland Tunnel / US 95." Bourne turns right-- Suddenly the window next to his head explodes as two more shots rip through his door to tear a jagged wound into the top of Bourne's leg. REVEAL Paz, his SUV racing along the curb lane. As Bourne's car crosses in front of a small car stopped at the intersection Paz swerves his car into that car and punches it into the side of Bourne's car. Bourne's car is knocked spinning, Paz keeps charging forward and slams into the back of Bourne's car. With his front tires spinning wildly Bourne fights to straighten his car as another CRI sedan appears and tries to box Bourne's car by sliding into his path. 283 OMITTED 283
S: 284 EXT. MANHATTAN STREET -- DAY 284
N: Bourne just manages to punch his car into the right rear of the CRI Sedan and race down the Avenue with Paz and the slightly damaged sedan in pursuit. Paz gains on him and Bourne is forced to swerve violently to deny Paz the kill shot he is all too capable of. Just ahead of Bourne, two government SUVs slide into the intersection completely blocking his path. Bourne instantly spins his car 180 degrees and continues on, barreling into the roadblock backwards. As Bourne's car plows through the SUV's he whips the wheel and his car spins through a reverse 180 as Paz and the other sedan race through the wreckage in Bourne's wake. Paz and the CRI sedan are all over Bourne as he slides a right hand turn onto South St. as Paz and the CRI sedan overwhelm Bourne's battered vehicle. 284A OMITTED 284A
S: 287 INT. BOURNE'S CAR -- DAY 287
N: On his police radio, Bourne singles out an NYPD officer (call sign Alpha-2503) racing toward the intersection just ahead. Bourne slows, then speeds up quickly to time it right: The CRI car almost hits his bumper, then has to accelerate through the upcoming intersection. As he does, the cop car Bourne was listening to on the radio slams broadside into the CRI sedan drafting the bumper of the mangled cop car. Swerving wildly Paz avoids the pileup and slams his heavy SUV into the back of Bourne's car, pushing him into the oncoming traffic. Several cars swerve left and right as Paz pushes Bourne sideways onto the ramped end of a K-Rail dividing the street ahead. The nearly upended car grinds down the K-Rail until the rear of Bourne's car strikes an obstruction which punches it back into the lane as it slams against the front of Paz's SUV, knocking the SUV sideways, into a row of parked cars. Bourne's car hits parked cars on the other side of the road. SMOKE and STEAM -- SIRENS -- CHAOS BOURNE kicks the window out of the police car. Gun up... Ready-- NEARBY 287A PAZ in the car. Still. Bloody from the crash, really 287A fucked up. He comes to...and Bourne is there. Gun pointed at his head... The two assassins look at each other...then Bourne lowers his gun...and disappears... ON PAZ -- as the wheels start to turn...

N: AFTERNOON Hirsch's office is located in the SRD's "front office", which is located covertly on a floor of the new building of the hospital. He is the longtime head of SRD and a powerful behind-the-scenes official at CIA. THE CAMERA FINDS DR. HIRSCH, 70, is, put simply, not a man to be trifled with. He's a 45 year CIA veteran. One of the great brains in the Agency's history, but also a man who knows how to wield power silently, invisibly, and to tremendous effect. His phone buzzes.

E: INTO PHONE
C: VOSEN
D: Not long. Get out of there.

C: BOURNE
D: They'll kill you for giving me this place.
C: LANDY

C: BOURNE
D: Why'd you do it?
C: LANDY
D: This isn't us, David. What they turned you into, what they're doing with Blackbriar... This has to stop.
C: BOURNE

N: Hirsch moves toward Bourne, completely unfazed by the gun.
C: HIRSCH
D: You still don't have it all back, do you? You haven't filled in all the pieces?
C: BOURNE
D: Let's start with the moment you found out I wouldn't execute Wombosi. The amnesia wasn't the issue, it was the fact that I didn't pull the trigger....
C: HIRSCH
D: One lapse meant your conditioning had failed.
N: Bourne grabs Hirsch and slams him against the wall
C: BOURNE
D: It was always you, behind Conklin, behind Abbott.... They were just following orders.
N: Bourne grabs Hirsch and pushes him to the wall. Searches him for weapons.

E: CONT'D
C: BOURNE
D: Who is he?
C: HIRSCH
D: We've been through that.
C: BOURNE
D: What did he do?
C: HIRSCH
D: It doesn't matter. You came to us. You volunteered. You said you'd do anything it takes to save American lives. You're not a liar are you? Or too weak to see this through? This is it. Let go of David Webb. Will you give yourself to this program?
