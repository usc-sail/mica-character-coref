        On final approach to JFK. Bourne looks out the window to
        see the Verizano Narrows bridge.   And beyond it,
        Manhattan.   Bourne is coming home.

                  Pam, You need to see this.

        Landy follows CRONIN into--


201     INT. CRONIN'S OFFICE -- DAY                                201

        BOURNE'S PASSPORT is displayed on the computer monitor.

                            CRONIN (CONT'D)
                  This passport just cleared
                  Immigration at JFK ten minutes
                  ago. It's an early Treadstone
                  identity registered to Jason
                  Bourne but he never used it and
                  it never went to the grid.
                  Bourne's alive.

                            LANDY
                  They don't know.

                            CRONIN
                  No, if they knew Vosen wouldn't
                  be in his office right now.

                                                             71

       Bourne moves through the airport.

                           LANDY (O.S.)
                 It's a hell of a risk.

                           CRONIN (O.S.)
                 Yeah. Maybe Bourne wants us to
                 know, just like Naples, maybe
                 he's communicating.


201    INT. CRONIN'S OFFICE                                       201

                 Maybe he's trying to communicate
                 with you.

                           LANDY
                 Maybe we should communicate back.
                 Because I think I know what
                 Bourne's looking for.

       Bourne uses his monocular to zoom in on a file Vosen is
       looking at -- he sees the word "Blackbriar." Vosen puts
       the file back in the safe.

                Landy!

      Vosen jumps up, sprints toward the hub--

                Are we triangulating?!

                           LANDY (V.O.)
                No. Off the record. You know
                how it is.

       Wills walks over to Vosen. The look in his eye indicates
       that he thinks there's something odd about this:

                            WILLS
                  Landy just left the building.

       Vosen looks at Wills.... A beat, Vosen's suspicion
       building, though he can't quite put his finger on what he
       suspects...

226A   INT. STAIRWAY                                            226A

       Bourne climbs stairs.   Walks down a dank hallway.


229    INT. VOSEN'S SUV                                            229

                           VOSEN
                 Copy that, I see her.

       Landy stands on a corner waiting for Bourne.

                                                             78


                           VOSEN (CONT'D)
                 Any sign of Bourne?


229A   INT. AMBIGUOUS SPACE                                      229A

       TIGHT SHOT on Bourne's face. FAST TILT to TIGHT ON his
       hands, pulling up what seems like a piece of clear tape.
       We can't tell where we are or what he's doing.


230    EXT. TUDOR CITY                                             230

       Landy looks around.


229A   INT. AMBIGUOUS SPACE                                      229A

       TIGHT ON Bourne's hands placing the clear tape on a piece
       of clear plastic. Again we can't tell what's going on.


231    EXT. TUTOR CITY                                             231

       Agents watch Landy.


232    INT. VOSEN'S SUV -- DAY                                     232

       Vosen's cell phone rings.

                           VOSEN
                 Noah Vosen.

                           BOURNE (V.O.)
                 This is Jason Bourne.

       VOSEN reels for a beat. Then quickly scans the streets,
       trying to see if he can spot BOURNE.

                           VOSEN
                 How did you get this number?

                           BOURNE (V.O.)
                 You didn't actually think I was
                 coming to Tudor City, did you?

                           VOSEN
                 No, I guess not. But if it's me
                 you want to talk to maybe we can
                 arrange a meet.

                           BOURNE (V.O.)
                 Where are you right now?

                           VOSEN
                 In my office.

                                                                   79


                               BOURNE (V.O.)
                     I doubt that. If you were in
                     your office--


233    INT. VOSEN'S OFFICE -- DAY                                       233

       REVEAL that BOURNE is inside VOSEN'S office.

                               BOURNE
                     We'd be having this conversation
                     face-to-face.

       BOURNE hangs up. Puts a portable dictaphone up to VOSEN'S
       SAFE and his play:

                               VOSEN (TAPE V.O.)
                     Noah Vosen.

       As he places the plastic slide we saw in the ECUs into the
       fingerprint reader. The safe pops open--


234    INT.   DAY.    VOSEN SUV                                         234

       VOSEN stunned....     Is it possible?   Is it a trick?


233    INT. DAY.     VOSEN'S OFFICE                                     233

       From the safe, BOURNE scoops out the "TREADSTONE:
       Blackbriar" folder Bourne saw Vosen putting into his safe."

       He flips it open. He scans down the page.         His eye
       stopping at the words "US Citizen."

       He flips to another page -- another photo, and again "US
       Citizen."

       BOURNE shoves the folders in his backpack and leaves.


234    INT. VOSEN'S SUV -- DAY                                          234

                     everybody back in the vehicles
                     this is a code ten abort! Back to
                     the vehicles immediately, back to

239    EXT. MANHATTAN -- DAY                                      239

       BOURNE walks out of a building, backpack over his shoulder.
       CAMERA BEGINS TO CRANE UP...

       BOURNE walks around a corner near CRI. He hears a siren
       turn on a few blocks away. Then another.   He starts to
       run.


240    INT. CRONIN'S CAR -- DAY                                   240

       A SEDAN pulls to a stop as a door comes open. CRONIN'S
       inside.   REVEAL Landy on the sidewalk. She jumps in.

                           LANDY
                 What just happened?

                           CRONIN
                 Bourne got into Vosen's safe.

                              LANDY
                 What?!

       Cronin pulls out.

                              CRONIN
                 Where to?

                           LANDY

        BOURNE walking away from CRI.

        Agents leaving a building.    Getting into unmarked sedans
        and peeling out.


240AA   INT. VOSEN'S SUV -- DAY                                   240AA

                  understand? I want him found!


240B    INT. CRI CAR -- DAY                                          240B

        The passenger side agent sees BOURNE, points--

        BOURNE cuts to the south side of the road so the passenger-
        side agent doesn't have a shot, while controlling the car
        makes it almost impossible for the driver to fire
        accurately.


240C    EXT. 41 STREET -- DAY                                        240C

        The westbound car cuts sharply and drives up on the
        sidewalk. But Bourne is too fast. He's already past them.
        The passenger side agent jumps out. But he's still got to
        get around the door and then move a few steps to get a bead
        over the hood of his car on Bourne.

        The other CRI car races the wrong way on the street but
        gets immobilized and trapped by the onrushing tunnel
        traffic.


242A    INT. VOSEN'S SUV -- DAY                                      242A

242B    SERIES OF SHOTS                                              242B

        CRI cars close in -- on 42nd, on 39th, on 10th Ave.


242C    EXT. MIDTOWN WEST -- DAY                                     242C

        Bourne races through the tunnel traffic and onto 40th
        street.   He rushes east toward the spaghetti of concrete
        ramps leading into and out of Port Authority.

                                                             82


       He runs across 10th Avenue as a third CRI car screams up
       the street at him.


243    INT. VOSEN'S SUV -- DAY                                     243

       Several radios blare.

                           CRI AGENT (RADIO V.O.)
                 He's heading for Port Authority!
                 Subject up the ramp, eastbound
                 into Port Authority.

258    EXT. PORT AUTHORITY -- DAY                                  258

       Bourne runs up a one lane outgoing ramp.


258A   INT. CRI CAR -- DAY                                        258A

       The driver pilots his car up the ramp behind Bourne. He
       jams the accelerator down.   He'll be on top of Bourne --
       running him over -- in seconds--


260    EXT. PORT AUTHORITY -- DAY                                  260

       A New Jersey-bound bus exits the complex and heads around
       the corner of the ramp -- it skids to a stop when it sees
       Bourne and the CRI car giving chase heading right at the
       bus.


260A   INT. CRI CAR -- DAY                                        260A

       The driver has to skid to a stop to avoid hitting the bus.
       Bourne slides between the side of the bus and concrete
       guard rail.   The driver calls it in--


261    SERIES OF SHOTS                                             261

       Cops and CRI cars close in on Port Authority.   One agent
       jumps out of his car on 8th Avenue and rushes for the
       stairs.

                                                               83


                          TACTICAL TEAM LEADER (V.O.)
                Block every exit. I want a full
                perimeter on Port Authority--


262   EXT. ROOFTOP PARKING LOT -- PORT AUTHORITY                    262

      Bourne races up a set of stairs the rooftop parking lot.
      He surveys every aspect of his environment on the fly
      (which includes his taking a quick peak over the concrete
      railing at the east end of the roof.

      Next Bourne rushes toward the parked cars. Smashes the
      window of one to set off its alarm.   Then a second and a
      third, setting off their alarms.

      The fourth window Bourne smashes in doesn't set off an
      alarm. Bourne pulls the door open and climbs in.

      Inside the car Bourne reaches under the dash and yanks
      handful of wires off the steering column and starts to
      expertly hotwire the car.

264   SERIES OF SHOTS                                               264

      Agents race up stairwells.   Two CRI cars careen up the
      ramp to the passenger parking (a separate ramp to the bus
      ramp we saw Bourne on earlier.) A third CRI car races
      through the parking level just below the roof and up the
      circular ramp to the roof.


      INT. VOSEN'S SUV -- DAY

                          TACTICAL TEAM LEADER
                    (to Vosen)
                He's on the roof.   He's trapped.


      EXT. ROOFTOP PARKING LOT -- PORT AUTHORITY

      Bourne works to hotwire the car.

      A CRI car gets to the roof.   Two agents come from the
      elevator lobby.   The three car alarms distract them. They
      search for Bourne, but can't find him at first...

      Bourne gets the car engine on - but, given the wonders of
      modern anti-theft technology his steering wheel is still
      locked.

                                                                84


      A second CRI car arrives.

      Bourne slams the car into low gear and backs up at high
      speed.

      He smashes into the car across the aisle from him. With a
      sharp metallic snap the wheel in Bourne's car is suddenly
      free, he jams the car into drive pulls out into lane and
      stops.

      Three CRI cars here now. Two head straight for him.   A
      third blocks the exit ramp.

      Bourne checks the rearview and sees two more agents pour
      from the elevator lobby, one carrying the serious firepower
      of an M-4 (an M-16 variant whose bullets can penetrate
      metal and concrete). They move into position to get a bead
      on him.

      Bourne assesses. But he doesn't move. The agents swarm
      toward him. What the hell is he doing? Why is he waiting?


267   INT. VOSEN'S SUV -- DAY                                        267

                          TACTICAL TEAM LEADER
                We've got him! He's got nowhere
                to run!

                          VOSEN
                Take him out!


268   EXT. ROOFTOP PARKING LOT -- PORT AUTHORITY                     268

      The agents clear their obstructions and drop their barrels
      toward Bourne--

      But before they can get a bead--

      Bourne slams the car into reverse again.   Petal to the
      metal in reverse--

      The agents open fire.

      Bourne ducks the lead slugs ripping through the windshield.
      But there's no dodging the shower of broken glass.

      As Bourne disappears below the dashboard, the CRI agent
      adjusts his fire into the car's grill.

      Virtually blind, Bourne races the hard-pressed vehicle
      backwards as the agent's fire decimates the car's
      driveline.

      Bourne slips the car into neutral and takes a quick peek
      behind him.

                                                            85


      Steers still speeding but quickly dying car towards a small
      gap between two parked cars at the edge of the parking
      structure.

      Bourne's car splits the gap between the parked cars, hits
      the base of a low angled wall that slams the back of his
      car up and over the wall.

      Bourne is pounded as his car jounces onto the wall, a
      second later the front end seesaws over the top, the sudden
      angle change exposes for an instant the bottom of Bourne's
      car, to the shooters.

      Several rounds rip through the floorboard and tear past
      Bourne's head just before his car drops upside down for 25
      feet and slams onto a row of parked cars.

      The impact rips Bourne from the seat and slams him hard
      against the roof.

      Bourne struggles out of the car, knowing he has only a
      moment before the armed agents will fire down into his over-
      turned car.

                           CRI AGENT
                 Ho-ly shit!


269   INT.   VOSEN'S SUV -- DAY                                   269

270   EXT. ROOFTOP PARKING LOT -- PORT AUTHORITY                  270

      The CRI agents race to the spot where Bourne's car
      disappeared over the railing and reflexively fire into
      Bourne's car but they're too late! Bourne's already out.
      He disappears from sight under the covered parking

      out of Port Authority -- two blocks away.

        One of the agents scrambles over the edge and starts to
        climb down. Other agents race for the stairs.

                            TACTICAL TEAM LEADER (V.O.)
                  Don't tell me--

                  --you've lost him! Who's on
                  street level?! Street level
                  backup?!

        Clearly there is no one down there. Bourne's car jump from
        the roof has completely flat-footed them.

                            VOSEN
                      (to Wills)
                  Get NYPD backup! And FBI, DEA,

274A    INT/EXT. CIRCULAR RAMP                                    274A

        Two CRI cars race down from the roof to try to get to the
        level Bourne's on.


275     INT./EXT. PARKING GARAGE -- TWO LEVELS BELOW ROOFTOP        275

        Bourne cuts off a guy cruising for a parking space and
        pulls him from his car and races away as the agent from the
        roof lands hard behind him.

        Bourne's race to the exit is cut off as a 3rd CRI sedan
        slides into view and it's occupants open fire on Bourne in
        a head on charge.

        The just stolen vehicle takes heavy fire as Bourne reacts
        instantaneously; thumbing on the cruise control,
        shouldering his door open, and slamming the gas pedal to
        the floor as he dives out of the car.

        The agents react as Bourne's sedan torpedoes them head on.
        Hit hard they're taken out of the fight as metal collapses,
        glass shatters, and airbags explode.

        Bourne tumbles to a stop at the rear of a parked car as his
        car implodes against the oncoming agents.

                                                       87


Instantly Bourne is on his feet, moving between the parked
cars to engage another CRI sedan traveling parallel to the
course of the wrecked one.

The agents in this sedan are distracted by the still
echoing crash and are caught off-guard as Bourne steps out
and points his gun at the driver.

The driver ducks and floors his gas pedal in a desperate
effort to save his own life. As the sedan suddenly
accelerates, Bourne deliberately shifts his aim to the
sedan's front tire and fires.

The tire explodes and the car suddenly veers left and slams
into a parked car, pitching the driver violently against
the unyielding interior of the sedan.

An instant later Bourne rips the radio off the dazed
drivers belt just before he cold cocks him with it.

With the wreck still echoing through the garage Bourne has
to deal with the arrival of the first NYPD sedan.

Bourne takes on the persona of an alarmed witness as the on
edge cop climbs out of his car but Bourne's performance is
cut short as the agent running from his drop from the roof,
arrives and opens fire.

The police officer goes down in the hail of gunfire as
Bourne turns and expertly drops the gunman with a single
shot.

The increasing volume of squealing tires alerts Bourne to a
new threat, he pulls the officer into some cover and grabs
the officer's radio.

                   BOURNE
          10-13. Shots fired. Officer
          down. Port Authority parking
          lot. Level four.

Bourne rips a piece of his sweater off and ties a makeshift
tourniquet for the officer.   Then he hands the cop his
radio back.

                    BOURNE (CONT'D)
          Stay out of sight until one of
          your own arrive.

Bourne disappears.

We pick him up as he jumps into the cops car and guns the
engine and heads for the exits.

CRI agents are confused for a second -- until they pick up
the NYPD car exiting Port Authority on one of the ramps.
But that's all the time Bourne needs--

                                                               88

277    EXT. CROSSTOWN STREET -- DAY                                 277

       Bourne turns on his lights and siren and speeds east,
       followed closely by a CRI sedan.

       As cars yield to Bourne's siren a taxi tries to jump into
       Bourne's wake but a CRI sedan punches the taxi back to the
       right. It ricochets off several parked cars before
       regaining control.

281    EXT. CROSSTOWN STREET -- DAY                                 281

       Bourne struggles to keep his over-matched vehicle ahead of
       the more powerful CRI Sedan which tries to spin Bourne out
       by hitting his bumper.

       Bourne tacks right quickly and barely avoids a stopped car.
       The CRI sedan flanking Bourne's slams into the rear of that
       car, spinning it 180 degrees into the path of the trailing
       CRI sedan which destroys itself in the resulting collision
       and blocks the path of the other CRI sedan.


282    INT. BOURNE'S CAR -- DAY                                     282

       Bourne is home free. He looks around and spots a sign that
       indicates a right turn and says "To Holland Tunnel / US
       95." Bourne turns right--

       Suddenly the window next to his head explodes as two more
       shots rip through his door to tear a jagged wound into the
       top of Bourne's leg.

       REVEAL Paz, his SUV racing along the curb lane. As
       Bourne's car crosses in front of a small car stopped at the
       intersection Paz swerves his car into that car and punches
       it into the side of Bourne's car.

       Bourne's car is knocked spinning, Paz keeps charging
       forward and slams into the back of Bourne's car. With his
       front tires spinning wildly Bourne fights to straighten his
       car as another CRI sedan appears and tries to box Bourne's
       car by sliding into his path.


283    OMITTED                                                      283

284    EXT. MANHATTAN STREET -- DAY                                  284

       Bourne just manages to punch his car into the right rear of
       the CRI Sedan and race down the Avenue with Paz and the
       slightly damaged sedan in pursuit.

       Paz gains on him and Bourne is forced to swerve violently
       to deny Paz the kill shot he is all too capable of.

       Just ahead of Bourne, two government SUVs slide into the
       intersection completely blocking his path.

       Bourne instantly spins his car 180 degrees and continues
       on, barreling into the roadblock backwards.

       As Bourne's car plows through the SUV's he whips the wheel
       and his car spins through a reverse 180 as Paz and the
       other sedan race through the wreckage in Bourne's wake.

       Paz and the CRI sedan are all over Bourne as he slides a
       right hand turn onto South St. as Paz and the CRI sedan
       overwhelm Bourne's battered vehicle.


284A   OMITTED                                                    284A


287    INT. BOURNE'S CAR -- DAY                                      287

       On his police radio, Bourne singles out an NYPD officer
       (call sign Alpha-2503) racing toward the intersection just
       ahead.

       Bourne slows, then speeds up quickly to time it right:

       The CRI car almost hits his bumper, then has to accelerate
       through the upcoming intersection. As he does, the cop car
       Bourne was listening to on the radio slams broadside into
       the CRI sedan drafting the bumper of the mangled cop car.

       Swerving wildly Paz avoids the pileup and slams his heavy
       SUV into the back of Bourne's car, pushing him into the
       oncoming traffic.

       Several cars swerve left and right as Paz pushes Bourne
       sideways onto the ramped end of a K-Rail dividing the
       street ahead.

       The nearly upended car grinds down the K-Rail until the
       rear of Bourne's car strikes an obstruction which punches
       it back into the lane as it slams against the front of
       Paz's SUV, knocking the SUV sideways, into a row of parked
       cars.

       Bourne's car hits parked cars on the other side of the
       road.

FB5    FLASHBACK                                                    FB5

       The image of "415" that has been haunting his dreams.


309    EXT.   NEW YORK -- HOSPITAL -- LATE AFTERNOON                309

       This is the place... When he looks down Landy steps out of
       the lobby to meet him on the sidewalk.

                                                                94


                             BOURNE
                   They'll kill you for giving me
                   this place.

                             LANDY
                   4/15/71 isn't much of a code. My
                   guess is Vosen's already on his
                   way.

                             BOURNE
                   Why'd you do it?

                             LANDY
                   This isn't us, David. What they
                   turned you into, what they're
                   doing with Blackbriar... This
                   has to stop.

                             BOURNE
                   Then stop it. Everything you
                   need is in there.

       Bourne hands her the black bag and enters the hospital.

                             LANDY
                   David... Come in with me. It's
                   better if we do this together.

                             BOURNE
                       (shakes head)
                   This is where it started for me,
                   this is where it ends.

       She watches the doors close behind him....     Landy lets him
       go.


323    EXT. NYC STREETS -- LATE AFTERNOON                            323

       QUICK SHOTS of six different CRI sedans and SUVs rushing
       toward the hospital.


309R   EXT. HOSPITAL -- LATE AFTERNOON                            309R

       Landy looks in the backpack.

       JUMPCUTS:

       --She unzips the backpack and looks in at the the
       Blackbriar Operations File.

       --A cover page inside: "utmost secrecy"... "potentially
       explosive public reaction would jeopardize the program"...

       --Another page: "Terminated" stamped across the photos of
       victims. Next to the victim from the inciting incident,
       the words: "US citizen"...

                                                                95


                           LANDY
                 Oh, my God...

       --A third page, more photos, no "terminated" on these.
       Future victims. "US citizen" stamped next to each one...


310    INT. HOSPITAL -- LATE AFERNOON                                310

       Bourne uses the card reader he took from Vosen's safe to
       enter a "restricted access elevator."   A guard comes.
       Bourne aims his pistol at him as the elevator door closes.


309R   EXT. FIRST AVENUE -- OUTSIDE HOSPITAL --    LATE AFTERNOON 309R

       Landy walks down the street. She looks up to spot two
       black sedans speeding east on 71st, turns south -- two SUVs
       coming up York.   Shit--


323    INT. VOSEN'S SUV -- LATE AFTERNOON                            323

       A block south of the hospital, stuck in traffic, Vosen
       points.

                           VOSEN
                 Landy! Right there!    She's got
                 Bourne's backpack!


310R   INT. 8TH FLOOR ELEVATOR LOBBY -- LATE AFTERNOON            310R

       Bourne flips up the elevator stop button and uses the
       access card to enter a secure corridor--


323    INT. LOBBY -- LATE AFTERNOON                                  323

       Landy runs across the lobby.


323    EXT. FIRST AVENUE -- LATE AFTERNOON                           323

       Vosen's SUV careens to a stop behind a bunch of traffic.
       Still a half block from the entry door but it's close
       enough--


322    INT. CORRRIDOR                                                322

       Bourne rushes down a nondescript corridor--


325    INT. HOSPITAL LOBBY -- LATE AFTERNOON                         325

       Vosen and CRI agents rush into the lobby.

                                                                   96


                             VOSEN
                       (to a group of six
                        agents)
                   I'll find Landy. You get to the
                   training wing and get Bourne!

       A security guard comes over.

                             VOSEN
                   Do you know who I am?
                       (the guard nods)
                   Where's your security room?


324    INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR                                           324

       Landy looks around. Finds an open office. She pushes open
       the door and runs to the fax machine. She starts faxing
       the Blackbriar documents Bourne took from Vosen's safe.


324A   INT. SECURITY ROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON                         324A

       Vosen enters.

                             VOSEN
                   I want to see all your footage
                   for the last three minutes.


322    INT. SRD TRAINING WING (OLD BUILDING OF HOSPITAL) -- LATE 322
       AFTERNOON

       Bourne stares down the corridor from his dreams, the
       corridor Daniels lead him down in his flashback.

       We see Bourne go into--


FBA3   FLASHBACK                                                    FBA3

       That first day, Bourne's POV being led down this corridor
       by Daniels.


322    BACK TO SCENE                                                    322

       Bourne moves down the corridor.


322    INT. SRD TRAINING WING (OLD BUILDING OF HOSPITAL) -- LATE 322
       AFTERNOON

       Bourne reaches the end of the hall.       He looks around
       "flashback style" --

                                                                97


FBB3   FLASHBACK                                                 FBB3

       Bourne was standing at this door....


331    INT. OFFICE -- LATE AFTERNOON                                 331

       Vosen enters the room.    The last pages have been faxed...

                             LANDY
                   You better get a good lawyer.

       She exits...


322    BACK TO SCENE                                                 322

       Then spins, gun up--

       Hirsch is there, halfway down the corridor behind him.

                             HIRSCH
                   Put the gun down. I wouldn't be
                   here if I didn't want to talk.

                              BOURNE
                   I've spent three years running.
                   Three years trying to find out
                   who I was.

       Hirsch moves toward Bourne, completely unfazed by the gun.

                             HIRSCH
                   You still don't have it all back,
                   do you? You haven't filled in
                   all the pieces?

                             BOURNE
                   Let's start with the moment you
                   found out I wouldn't execute
                   Wombosi. The amnesia wasn't the
                   issue, it was the fact that I
                   didn't pull the trigger....

                             HIRSCH
                   One lapse meant your conditioning
                   had failed.

       Bourne grabs Hirsch and slams him against the wall

                             BOURNE
                   It was always you, behind
                   Conklin, behind Abbott.... They
                   were just following orders.

       Bourne grabs Hirsch and pushes him to the wall.   Searches
       him for weapons.

                                                             98


                             HIRSCH
                       (completely calm)
                   I'm unarmed, Jason.

                             BOURNE
                       (shoving Hirsch hard
                        against the wall)
                   "David." I'm David Webb.

       CLOSE ON Bourne's face--

                             HIRSCH
                   You were David Webb, but not
                   anymore.


322    INT. SRD TRAINING WING CORRIDOR -- LATE AFERNOON           322

       Bourne stands with Hirsch.

                              BOURNE
                   Why me?   Why did you pick me?

       A beat...

                               HIRSCH
                   You really don't remember, do
                   you?
                        (beat)
                   You picked us, Jason.

                             BOURNE
                   What does that mean?

                             HIRSCH
                   You volunteered.

       Hirsch uses his free hand to hit the keypad on the wall.
       The "room in use" sign lights up.

       Bourne looks up "flashback style"--


FBA1   FLASHBACK                                                  FBA1

       Bourne remembers that keypad, that "room in use" sign from
       the first day...


322    INT. ROOM WHERE BOURNE FIRST MET HIRSCH                    322

       Bourne and Hirsch enter...

                             HIRSCH
                   You volunteered right here....
                   You didn't even blink, Jason.
                   You just handed me these...

                                                             99


       Hirsch removes a pair of dog tags from his jacket pocket.
       Holds them out to Bourne.

       Bourne takes the dog tags.        Stares at them.

       INSERT of the dog tags:

       Webb, David

       Bourne hands over his dog tags....


                              HIRSCH (CONT'D)
                    Has everything been explained to
                    you.

                                BOURNE
                    Yes, sir.

322    PRESENT DAY                                                 322

                              HIRSCH
                    You were a soldier ready to serve
                    his country. Just like thousands
                    of others, except you were a
                    prodigy with languages...and a
                    perfect shot.

322    PRESENT DAY                                                 322

                              BOURNE
                    You said I'd be saving American
                    lives. Instead you just turned me
                    into a killer.

       Bourne raises the gun to Hirsch.

                              HIRSCH
                    You could have left at any time.
                    And you knew exactly what it
                    meant for you if you chose to
                    stay.

                                                               100

                    When we're finished with you,

                              BOURNE

                    be, sir.


322    PRESENT DAY                                                   322

                              HIRSCH
                    Stop running from the truth,
                    Jason. You chose to come here!
                    You chose to stay! And no matter
                    how much you want to forget
                    it...eventually you're going to
                    have to face how you chose, right
                    there, to become Jason Bourne!



FB10   FLASHBACK:                                                 FB10

       Bourne sitting in a chair, looking terrible.     Hirsch looks
       at him from behind the desk...

                              HIRSCH (CONT'D)
                    You haven't slept for a long time
                    have you David? Have you made a
                    decision? This can't go on, you
                    know. You have to decide.

                                 BOURNE
                    Who is he?

                              HIRSCH
                    We've been through that.

                              BOURNE
                    What did he do?

                               HIRSCH
                    It doesn't matter.
                        (beat)
                    You came to us. You volunteered.
                    You said you'd do anything it
                    takes to save American lives.
                    You're not a liar are you? Or too
                    weak to see this through? This is
                    it. Let go of David Webb. Will
                    you give yourself to this
                    program?

                                                             101


      Bourne looks down, a gun in his hand. He gets to his feet
      swiftly and fires the pistol several times into a hooded
      figure. The man slumps over.

      Bourne stares at what he's done.

                          HIRSCH (CONT'D)
                You're no longer David Webb.
                From now on you'll be known as
                Jason Bourne. Welcome to the
                program.

      Daniels pulls the hood off the figure to show that he is
      dead.

      Just then Kramer walks through the door.

                          KRAMER
                He's ready. Send him to
                Operations.


322   PRESENT                                                      322

      And now, in real time, Bourne comes out of the flashback.
      He stares back at Hirsch....

                          HIRSCH
                Do you remember now?

      Bourne lowers the gun.

                          BOURNE
                I remember. I remember
                everything.

                          HIRSCH
                You can't outrun what you did,
                Jason. You made yourself into
                who you are.

                          BOURNE
                I'm done running.  That's why
                I'm here. To end you, to shut
                this down. I'm no longer Jason
                Bourne.

                          HIRSCH
                So now you're going to kill me?

                          BOURNE
                No. You don't deserve the star
                they give you on the wall at
                Langley.

      Just then Bourne spins -- agents arrive at the door.    It's
      locked.
