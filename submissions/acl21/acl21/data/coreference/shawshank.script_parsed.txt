S: 1 INT -- CABIN -- NIGHT (1946)
N: A dark, empty room. The door bursts open. A MAN and WOMAN enter, drunk and giggling, horny as hell. No sooner is the door shut than they're all over each other, ripping at clothes, pawing at flesh, mouths locked together. He gropes for a lamp, tries to turn it on, knocks it over instead. Hell with it. He's got more urgent things to do, like getting her blouse open and his hands on her breasts. She arches, moaning, fumbling with his fly. He slams her against the wall, ripping her skirt. We hear fabric tear. He enters her right then and there, roughly, up against the wall. She cries out, hitting her head against the wall but not caring, grinding against him, clawing his back, shivering with the sensations running through her. He carries her across the room with her legs wrapped around him. They fall onto the bed. CAMERA PULLS BACK, exiting through the window, traveling smoothly outside...
S: 2 EXT -- CABIN -- NIGHT (1946) 2
N: ...to reveal the bungalow, remote in a wooded area, the lovers' cries spilling into the night... ...and we drift down a wooded path, the sounds of rutting passion growing fainter, mingling now with the night sounds of crickets and hoot owls... ...and we begin to hear FAINT MUSIC in the woods, tinny and incongruous, and still we keep PULLING BACK until... ...a car is revealed. A 1946 Plymouth. Parked in a clearing.
S: 3 INT -- PLYMOUTH -- NIGHT (1946) 3
N: ANDY DUFRESNE, mid-20's, wire rim glasses, three-piece suit. Under normal circumstances a respectable, solid citizen; hardly dangerous, perhaps even meek. But these circumstances are far from normal. He is disheveled, unshaven, and very drunk. A cigarette smolders in his mouth. His eyes, flinty and hard, are riveted to the bungalow up the path. He can hear them fucking from here. He raises a bottle of bourbon and knocks it back. The radio plays softly, painfully romantic, taunting him: You stepped out of a dream... You are too wonderful... To be what you seem... He opens the glove compartment, pulls out an object wrapped in a rag. He lays it in his lap and unwraps it carefully -- -- revealing a .38 revolver. Oily, black, evil. He grabs a box of bullets. Spills them everywhere, all over the seats and floor. Clumsy. He picks bullets off his lap, loading them into the gun, one by one, methodical and grim. Six in the chamber. His gaze goes back to the bungalow. He shuts off the radio. Abrupt silence, except for the distant lovers' moans. He takes another shot of bourbon courage, then opens the door and steps from the car.
S: 4 EXT -- PLYMOUTH -- NIGHT (1946) 4
N: His wingtip shoes crunch on gravel. Loose bullets scatter to the ground. The bourbon bottle drops and shatters. He starts up the path, unsteady on his feet. The closer he gets, the louder the lovemaking becomes. Louder and more frenzied. The lovers are reaching a climax, their sounds of passion degenerating into rhythmic gasps and grunts.
C: WOMAN
D: Oh god...oh god...oh god...
E: O.S.
N: Andy lurches to a stop, listening. The woman cries out in orgasm. The sound slams into Andy's brain like an icepick. He shuts his eyes tightly, wishing the sound would stop. It finally does, dying away like a siren until all that's left is the shallow gasping and panting of post-coitus. We hear languorous laughter, moans of satisfaction.
C: WOMAN
D: Oh god...that's sooo good...you're the best...the best I ever had...
E: O.S.
N: Andy just stands and listens, devastated. He doesn't look like much of a killer now; he's just a sad little man on a dirt path in the woods, tears streaming down his face, a loaded gun held loosely at his side. A pathetic figure, really. FADE TO BLACK: 1ST TITLE UP
S: 5 INT -- COURTROOM -- DAY (1946) 5
N: THE JURY listens like a gallery of mannequins on display, pale-faced and stupefied.
C: D.A.
D: Mr. Dufresne, describe the confrontation you had with your wife the night she was murdered.
E: O.S.
N: ANDY DUFRESNE is on the witness stand, hands folded, suit and tie pressed, hair meticulously combed. He speaks in soft, measured tones:
C: ANDY
D: It was very bitter. She said she was glad I knew, that she hated all the sneaking around. She said she wanted a divorce in Reno.
C: D.A.
D: What was your response?
C: ANDY
D: I told her I would not grant one.
C: D.A.
D: I'll see you in Hell before I see you in Reno. Those were the words you used, Mr. Dufresne, according to the testimony of your neighbors.
E: refers to his notes
C: ANDY
D: If they say so. I really don't remember. I was upset.
N: FADE TO BLACK: 2ND TITLE UP
C: D.A.
D: What happened after you and your wife argued?
C: ANDY
D: She packed a bag and went to stay with Mr. Quentin.
C: D.A.
D: Glenn Quentin. The golf pro at the Falmouth Hills Country Club. The man you had recently discovered was her lover. Did you follow her?
E: Andy nods
C: ANDY
D: I went to a few bars first. Later, I decided to drive to Mr. Quentin's home and confront them. They weren't there...so I parked my car in the turnout...and waited.
C: D.A.
D: With what intention?
C: ANDY
D: I'm not sure. I was confused. Drunk. I think mostly I wanted to scare them.
C: D.A.
D: You had a gun with you?
C: ANDY
D: Yes. I did.
N: FADE TO BLACK: 3RD TITLE UP
C: D.A.
D: When they arrived, you went up to the house and murdered them?
C: ANDY
D: No. I was sobering up. I realized she wasn't worth it. I decided to let her have her quickie divorce.
C: D.A.
D: Quickie divorce indeed. A .38 caliber divorce, wrapped in a handtowel to muffle the shots, isn't that what you mean? And then you shot her lover!
C: ANDY
D: I did not. I got back in the car and drove home to sleep it off. Along the way, I stopped and threw my gun into the Royal River. I feel I've been very clear on this point.
C: D.A.
D: Yes, you have. Where I get hazy, though, is the part where the cleaning woman shows up the next morning and finds your wife and her lover in bed, riddled with .38 caliber bullets. Does that strike you as a fantastic coincidence, Mr. Dufresne, or is it just me?
C: ANDY
D: Yes. It does.
E: softly
C: D.A.
D: I'm sorry, Mr. Dufresne, I don't think the jury heard that.
C: ANDY
D: Yes. It does.
C: D.A.
D: Does what?
C: ANDY
D: Strike me as a fantastic coincidence.
C: D.A.
D: On that, sir, we are in accord...
N: FADE TO BLACK! 4TH TITLE UP
C: D.A.
D: You claim you threw your gun into the Royal River before the murders took place. That's rather convenient.
C: ANDY
D: It's the truth.
C: D.A.
D: You recall Lt. Mincher's testimony? He and his men dragged that river for three days and nary a gun was found. So no comparison can be made between your gun and the bullets taken from the bloodstained corpses of the victims. That's also rather convenient, isn't it, Mr. Dufresne?
C: ANDY
D: Since I am innocent of this crime, sir, I find it decidedly inconvenient the gun was never found.
E: faint, bitter smile
N: FADE TO BLACK: STH TITLE UP
S: 6 INT -- COURTROOM -- DAY (1946) 6
N: The D.A. holds the jury spellbound with his closing summation:
C: D.A.
D: Ladies and gentlemen, you've heard all the evidence, you know all the facts. We have the accused at the scene of the crime. We have foot prints. Tire tracks. Bullets scattered on the ground which bear his fingerprints. A broken bourbon bottle, likewise with fingerprints. Most of all, we have a beautiful young woman and her lover lying dead in each other's arms. They had sinned. But was their crime so great as to merit a death sentence?
N: He gestures to Andy sitting quietly with his ATTORNEY.
C: D.A.
D: I suspect Mr. Dufresne's answer to that would be yes. I further suspect he carried out that sentence on the night of September 21st, this year of our Lord, 1946, by pumping four bullets into his wife and another four into Glenn Quentin. And while you think about that, think about this...
N: He picks up a revolver, spins the cylinder before their eyes like a carnival barker spinning a wheel of fortune.
C: D.A.
D: A revolver holds six bullets, not eight. I submit to you this was not a hot-blooded crime of passion! That could at least be understood, if not condoned. No, this was revenge of a much more brutal and cold-blooded nature. Consider! Four bullets per victim! Not six shots fired, but eight! That means he fired the gun empty...and then stopped to reload so he could shoot each of them again! An extra bullet per lover...right in the head. I'm done talking. You people are all decent, God-fearing Christian folk. You know what to do.
E: a few JURORS shiver
N: FADE TO BLACK: 6TH TITLE UP
S: 7 INT -- JURY ROOM -- DAY (1946) 7
N: CAMERA TRACKS down a long table, moving from one JUROR to the next. These decent, God-fearing Christians are chowing down on a nice fried chicken dinner provided them by the county, smacking greasy lips and gnawing cobbettes of corn.
C: VOICE
D: Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty...
E: O.S.
N: We find the FOREMAN at the head of the table, sorting votes. FADE TO BLACK: 7TH TITLE UP
S: 8 INT -- COURTROOM -- DAY (1946) 8
N: Andy stands before the dias. THE JUDGE peers down, framed by a carved frieze of blind Lady Justice on the wall.
C: JUDGE
D: You strike me as a particularly icy and remorseless man, Mr. Dufresne. It chills my blood just to look at you. By the power vested in me by the State of Maine, I hereby order you to serve two life sentences, back to back, one for each of your victims. So be it.
N: He raps his gavel as we CRASH TO BLACK: LAST TITLE UP. 9 AN IRON-BARRED DOOR 9 slides open with an enormous CLANG. A stark room waits beyond. CAMERA PUSHES through. SEVEN HUMORLESS MEN sit side by side at a long table. An empty chair faces them. We are now in:
S: INT -- SHAWSHANK HEARINGS ROOM -- DAY (1947)
N: RED enters, removes his cap and waits by the chair.
C: MAN #1
D: Sit.
N: Red sits, tries not to slouch. The chair is uncomfortable.
C: MAN #2
D: We see by your file you've served twenty years of a life sentence.
C: MAN #3
D: You feel you've been rehabilitated?
C: RED
D: Yes, sir. Absolutely. I've learned my lesson. I can honestly say I'm a changed man. I'm no longer a danger to society. That's the God's honest truth. No doubt about it.
N: The men just stare at him. One stifles a yawn. CLOSEUP -- PAROLE FORM A big rubber stamp slams down: "REJECTED" in red ink.
S: 10 EXT -- EXERCISE YARD -- SHAWSHANK PRISON -- DUSK (1947) 10
N: High stone walls topped with snaky concertina wire, set off at intervals by looming guard towers. Over a hundred CONS are in the yard. Playing catch, shooting craps, jawing at each other, making deals. Exercise period. RED emerges into fading daylight, slouches low-key through the activity, worn cap on his head, exchanging hellos and doing minor business. He's an important man here.
C: RED
D: There's a con like me in every prison in America, I guess. I'm the guy who can get it for you. Cigarettes, a bag of reefer if you're partial, a bottle of brandy to celebrate your kid's high school graduation. Damn near anything, within reason.
E: V.O.
N: He slips somebody a pack of smokes, smooth sleight-of-hand.
C: RED
D: Yes sir, I'm a regular Sears & Roebuck.
E: V.O.
N: TWO SHORT SIREN BLASTS issue from the main tower, drawing everybody's attention to the loading dock. The outer gate swings open...revealing a gray prison bus outside.
C: RED
D: So when Andy Dufresne came to me in 1949 and asked me to smuggle Rita Hayworth into the prison for him, I told him no problem. And it wasn't.
E: V.O.
C: CON
D: Fresh fish! Fresh fish today!
N: Red is joined by HEYWOOD, SKEET, FLOYD, JIGGER, ERNIE, SNOOZE. Most cons crowd to the fence to gawk and jeer, but Red and his group mount the bleachers and settle in comfortably.
S: 11 INT -- PRISON BUS -- DUSK (1947) 11
N: Andy sits in back, wearing steel collar and chains.
C: RED
D: Andy came to Shawshank Prison in early 1947 for murdering his wife and the fella she was bangin'.
E: V.O.
N: The bus lurches forward, RUMBLES through the gates. Andy gazes around, swallowed by prison walls.
C: RED
D: On the outside, he'd been vice- president of a large Portland bank. Good work for a man as young as he was, when you consider how conservative banks were back then.
E: V.O.
C: TOWER GUARD
D: All clear!
N: GUARDS approach the bus with carbines. The door jerks open. The new fish disembark, chained together single-file, blinking sourly at their surroundings. Andy stumbles against the MAN in front of him, almost drags him down. BYRON HADLEY, captain of the guard, slams his baton into Andy's back. Andy goes to his knees, gasping in pain. JEERS and SHOUTS from the spectators.
C: HADLEY
D: On your feet before I fuck you up so bad you never walk again.
N: 13 ON THE BLEACHERS 13
C: RED
D: There they are, boys. The Human Charm Bracelet.
C: HEYWOOD
D: Never seen such a sorry-lookin' heap of maggot shit in my life.
C: JIGGER
D: Comin' from you, Heywood, you being so pretty and all...
C: FLOYD
D: Takin' bets today, Red?
C: RED
D: Bear Catholic? Pope shit in the woods? Smokes or coin, bettor's choice.
E: pulls notepad and pencil
C: FLOYD
D: Smokes. Put me down for two.
C: RED
D: High roller. Who's your horse?
C: FLOYD
D: That gangly sack of shit, third from the front. He'll be the first.
C: HEYWOOD
D: Bullshit. I'll take that action.
C: ERNIE
D: Me too.
N: Other hands go up. Red jots the names.
C: HEYWOOD
D: You're out some smokes, son. Take my word.
C: FLOYD
D: You're so smart, you call it.
C: HEYWOOD
D: I say that chubby fat-ass...let's see...fifth from the front. Put me down for a quarter deck.
C: RED
D: That's five cigarettes on Fat-Ass. Any takers?
N: More hands go up. Andy and the others are paraded along, forced by their chains to take tiny baby steps, flinching under the barrage of jeers and shouts. The old-timers are shaking the fence, trying to make the newcomers shit their pants. Some of the new fish shout back, but mostly they look terrified. Especially Andy.
C: RED
D: I must admit I didn't think much of Andy first time I laid eyes on him. He might'a been important on the outside, but in here he was just a little turd in prison grays. Looked like a stiff breeze could blow him over. That was my first impression of the man.
E: V.O.
C: SKEET
D: What say, Red?
C: RED
D: Little fella on the end. Definitely. I stake half a pack. Any takers?
C: SNOOZE
D: Rich bet.
C: RED
D: C'mon, boys, who's gonna prove me wrong? Floyd, Skeet, Joe, Heywood. Four brave souls, ten smokes apiece. That's it, gentlemen, this window's closed.
E: hands go up
N: Red pockets his notepad. A VOICE comes over the P.A. speakers:
C: VOICE
D: Return to your cellblocks for evening count.
E: amplified
S: 14 INT -- ADMITTING AREA -- DUSK (1947) 14
N: The new fish are marched in. Guards unlock the shackles. The chains drop away, rattling to the stone floor.
C: HADLEY
D: Eyes front.
N: WARDEN SAMUEL NORTON strolls forth, a colorless man in a gray suit and a church pin in his lapel. He looks like he could piss ice water. He appraises the newcomers with flinty eyes.
C: NORTON
D: This is Mr. Hadley, captain of the guard. I am Mr. Norton, the warden. You are sinners and scum, that's why they sent you to me. Rule number one: no blaspheming. I'll not have the Lord's name taken in vain in my prison. The other rules you'll figure out as you go along. Any questions?
C: CON
D: When do we eat?
N: Cued by Norton's glance, Hadley steps up to the con and screams right in his face:
C: HADLEY
D: YOU EAT WHEN WE SAY YOU EAT! YOU PISS WHEN WE SAY YOU PISS! YOU SHIT WHEN WE SAY YOU SHIT! YOU SLEEP WHEN WE SAY YOU SLEEP! YOU MAGGOT- DICK MOTHERFUCKER!
N: Hadley rams the tip of his club into the con's belly. The man falls to his knees, gasping and clutching himself. Hadley takes his place at Norton's side again. Softly:
C: NORTON
D: Any other questions? I believe in two things. Discipline and the Bible. Here, you'll receive both. Put your faith in the Lord. Your ass belongs to me. Welcome to Shawshank.
E: there are none holds up a Bible
C: HADLEY
D: Off with them clothes! And I didn't say take all day doing it, did I?
N: The men shed their clothes. Within seconds, all stand naked.
C: HADLEY
D: First man into the shower!
N: Hadley shoves the FIRST CON into a steel cage open at the front. TWO GUARDS open up with a fire hose. The con is slammed against the back of the cage, sputtering and hollering. Seconds later, the water is cut and the con yanked out.
C: HADLEY
D: Delouse that piece of shit! Next man in!
N: The con gets a huge scoop of white delousing powder thrown all over him. Gasping and coughing, blinking powder from his eyes, he gets shoved to a trustee's cage. The TRUSTEE slides a short stack of items through the slot -- prison clothes and a Bible. All the men are processed quickly -- a blast of water, powder, clothes and a Bible...
S: 15 INT -- INFIRMARY -- NIGHT (1947) 15
N: A naked CON steps before a DOCTOR and gets a cursory exam. A penlight is shined in his eyes, ears, nose, and throat.
C: DOCTOR
D: Bend over.
N: The con does. A GUARD with a penlight in his teeth spreads his cheeks, peers up his ass, and nods. Andy is next up. He gets the same treatment.
S: 16 INT -- PRISON CHAPEL -- NIGHT (1947) 16
N: CAMERA TRACKS the naked newcomers shivering on hard wooden chairs, clothes on their laps, Bibles open.
C: CHAPLAIN
D: ...maketh me to lie down in green pastures. He leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul...
E: O.S.
S: 17 INT -- CELLBLOCK FIVE -- NIGHT (1947) 17
N: Three tiers to a side, concrete and steel, gray and imposing. Andy and the others are marched in, still naked, carrying their clothes and Bibles. The CONS in their cells greet them with TAUNTS, JEERS, and LAUGHTER. One by one, the new men are shown to their cells and locked in with a CLANG OF STEEL.
C: RED
D: The first night's the toughest, no doubt about it. They march you in naked as the day you're born, fresh from a Bible reading, skin burning and half-blind from that delousing shit they throw on you...
E: V.O.
N: Red watches from his cell, arms slung over the crossbars, cigarette dangling from his fingers.
C: RED
D: ...and when they put you in that cell, when those bars slam home, that's when you know it's for real. Old life blown away in the blink of an eye...a long cold season in hell stretching out ahead...nothing left but all the time in the world to think about it.
E: V.O.
N: Red listens to the CLANGING below. He watches Andy and a few others being brought up to the 2nd tier.
C: RED
D: Most new fish come close to madness the first night. Somebody always breaks down crying. Happens every time. The only question is, who's it gonna be?
E: V.O.
N: Andy is led past and given a cell at the end of the tier.
C: RED
D: It's as good a thing to bet on as any, I guess. I had my money on Andy Dufresne...
E: V.O.
S: 18 INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1947) 18
N: The bars slam home. Andy is alone in his cell, clutching his clothes. He gazes around at his new surroundings, taking it in. He slowly begins to dress himself...
S: 19 EXT -- SHAWSHANK PRISON -- NIGHT (1947) 19
N: A malignant stone growth on the Maine landscape. The moon hangs low and baleful in a dead sky. The headlight of a PASSING TRAIN cuts through the night.
S: 20 INT -- RED'S CELL -- NIGHT (1947) 20
N: Red lies on his bunk below us, tossing his baseball toward the ceiling and catching it again. He pauses, listening. FOOTSTEPS approach below, unhurried, echoing hollowly on stone.
S: 21 INT -- CELLBLOCK FIVE -- NIGHT (1947) 21
N: LOW ANGLE. A CELLBLOCK GUARD strolls into frame.
C: GUARD
D: That's lights out! Good night, ladies.
N: The lights bump off in sequence. The guard exits, footsteps echoing away. Darkness now. Silence. CAMERA CRANES UP the tiers toward Red's cell.
C: RED
D: I remember my first night. Seems a long time ago now.
E: V.O.
N: Red looms from the darkness, leans on the bars. Listens. Waits. From somewhere below comes faint, ghastly tittering. VOICES drift through the cellblock, taunting:
C: VARIOUS VOICES
D: Fishee fishee fisheeee...You're gonna like it here, new fish. A whooole lot...Make you wish your daddies never dicked your mommies...You takin' this down, new fish? Gonna be a quiz later. Sshhh. Keep it down. The screws'll hear...Fishee fishee fisheeee...
E: O.S. somebody LAUGHS
C: RED
D: The boys always go fishin' with first-timers...and they don't quit till they reel someone in.
E: V.O.
N: The VOICES keep on, sly and creepy in the dark...
S: 22 INT -- VARIOUS CELLS -- NIGHT (1947) 22
N: thru thru 25 2g ...while the new cons go quietly crazy in their cells. One man paces like a caged animal...another sits gnawing his cuticles bloody...a third is weeping silently...a fourth is dry-heaving into the toilet...
S: 26 INT -- RED'S CELL -- NIGHT (1947) 26
N: Red waits at the bars. Smoking. Listening. He cranes his head, peers down toward Andy's cell. Nothing. Not a peep.
C: HEYWOOD
D: Fat-Ass...oh, Faaaat-Ass. Talk to me, boy. I know you're in there. I can hear you breathin'. Now don't you listen to these nitwits, hear?
E: O.S.
S: 27 INT -- FAT-ASS' CELL -- NIGHT (1947) 27
N: Fat-Ass is crying, trying not to hyperventilate.
C: HEYWOOD
D: This ain't such a bad place. I'll introduce you around, make you feel right at home. I know some big ol' bull queers who'd love to make your acquaintance...especially that big white mushy butt of yours...
E: O.S.
N: And that's it. Fat-Ass lets out a LOUD WAIL of despair:
C: FAT-ASS
D: OH GOD! I DON'T BELONG HERE! I WANNA GO HOME!
S: 28 INT -- HEYWOOD'S CELL -- NIGHT (1947) 28
C: HEYWOOD
D: AND IT'S FAT-ASS BY A NOSE.'
S: 29 INT -- CELLBLOCK -- NIGHT (1947) 29
N: The place goes nuts. Fat-Ass throws himself screaming against the bars. The entire block starts CHANTING:
C: VOICES
D: Fresh fish...fresh fish...fresh fish...fresh fish...
C: FAT-ASS
D: I WANNA GO HOME! I WANT MY MOTHER.'
C: VOICE
D: I had your mother! She wasn't that great!
E: O.S.
N: The lights bump on. GUARDS pour in, led by Hadley himself.
C: HADLEY
D: What the Christ is this happy shit?
C: VOICE
D: He took the Lord's name in vain! I'm tellin' the warden!
E: O.S.
C: HADLEY
D: You'll be tellin' him with my baton up your ass!
E: to the unseen wit
N: Hadley arrives at Fat-Ass' cell, bellowing through the bars:
C: HADLEY
D: What's your malfunction you fat fuckin' barrel of monkey-spunk?
C: FAT-ASS
D: PLEASE! THIS AIN'T RIGHT! I AIN'T SUPPOSED TO BE HERE! NOT ME!
C: HADLEY
D: I ain't gonna count to three! Not even to one! Now shut the fuck up 'fore I sing you a lullabye!
N: Fat-Ass keeps blubbering and wailing. Total freak-out. Hadley draws his baton, gestures to his men. Open it. A GUARD unlocks the cell. Hadley pulls Fat-Ass out and starts beating him with the baton, brutally raining blows. Fat-Ass falls, tries to crawl. The place goes dead silent. All we hear now is the dull THWACK-THWACK-THWACK of the baton. Fat-ass passes out. Hadley gets in a few more licks and finally stops.
C: HADLEY
D: Get this tub of shit down to the infirmary. If I hear so much as a mouse fart in here the rest of the night, by God and Sonny Jesus, you'll all visit the infirmary. Every last motherfucker here.
E: peers around
N: The guards wrestle Fat-Ass onto a stretcher and carry him off. FOOTSTEPS echo away. Lights off. Darkness again. Silence.
S: 30 INT -- RED'S CELL -- NIGHT (1947) 30
N: Red stares through the bars at the main floor below, eyes riveted to the small puddle of blood where Fat-Ass went down.
C: RED
D: His first night in the joint, Andy Dufresne cost me two packs of cigarettes. He never made a sound...
E: V.O.
S: 31 INT -- CELLBLOCK FIVE -- MORNING (1947) 31
N: LOUD BUZZER. The master locks are thrown -- KA-THUMP! The cons step from their cells, lining the tiers. The GUARDS holler their head-counts to the HEAD BULL, who jots on a clipboard. Red peers at Andy, checking him out. Andy stands in line, collar buttoned, hair combed.
S: 32 INT -- MESS HALL -- MORNING (1947) 32
N: Andy goes through the breakfast line, gets a scoop of glop on his tray. WE PAN ANDY through the noise and confusion...and discover BOGS DIAMOND and ROOSTER MacBRIDE watching Andy go by. Bogs sizes Andy up with a salacious gleam in his eye, mutters something to Rooster. Rooster laughs. Andy finds a table occupied by Red and his regulars, chooses a spot at the end where nobody is sitting. Ignoring their stares, he picks up his spoon -- and pauses, seeing something in his food. He carefully fishes it out with his fingers. It's a squirming maggot. Andy grimaces, unsure what to do with it. BROOKS HATLEN is sitting closest to Andy. At age 65, he's a senior citizen, a long-standing resident.
C: BROOKS
D: You gonna eat that?
C: ANDY
D: Hadn't planned on it.
C: BROOKS
D: You mind?
N: Andy passes the maggot to Brooks. Brooks examines it, rolling it between his fingertips like a man checking out a fine cigar. Andy is riveted with apprehension.
C: BROOKS
D: Mmm. Nice and ripe.
N: Andy can't bear to watch. Brooks opens up his sweater and feeds the maggot to a baby crow nestled in an inside pocket. Andy breathes a sigh of relief.
C: BROOKS
D: Jake says thanks. Fell out of his nest over by the plate shop. I'm lookin' after him till he's old enough to fly.
N: Andy nods, proceeds to eat. Carefully. Heywood approaches.
C: JIGGER
D: Oh, Christ, here he comes.
C: HEYWOOD
D: Mornin', boys. It's a fine mornin'. You know why it's fine?
N: Heywood plops his tray down, sits. The men start pulling out cigarettes and handing them down.
C: HEYWOOD
D: That's right, send 'em all down. I wanna see 'em lined up in a row, pretty as a chorus line.
N: An impressive pile forms. Heywood bends down and inhales deeply, smelling the aroma. Rapture.
C: FLOYD
D: Smell my ass...
C: HEYWOOD
D: Gee, Red. Terrible shame, your horse comin' in last and all. Hell, I sure do love that horse of mine. I believe I owe that boy a big sloppy kiss when I see him.
C: RED
D: Give him some'a your cigarettes instead, cheap bastard.
C: HEYWOOD
D: Say Tyrell, you pull infirmary duty this week? How's that winnin' horse of mine, anyway?
C: TYRELL
D: Dead. Hadley busted his head pretty good. Doc already went home for the night. Poor bastard lay there till this morning. By then...
E: the men fall silent
N: He shakes his head, turns back to his food. The silence mounts. Heywood glances around. Men resume eating. Softly:
C: ANDY
D: What was his name?
C: HEYWOOD
D: What? What'd you say?
C: ANDY
D: I was wondering if anyone knew his name.
C: HEYWOOD
D: What the fuck you care, new fish? Doesn't matter what his fuckin' name was. He's dead.
E: resumes eating
S: 33 INT -- PRISON LAUNDRY -- DAY (1947) 33
N: A DEAFENING NOISE of industrial washers and presses. Andy works the laundry line. A nightmarish job. He's new at it. BOB, the con foreman, elbows him aside and shows him how it's done.
S: 34 INT -- SHOWERS -- DAY (1947) 34
N: Shower heads mounted in bare concrete. Andy showers with a dozen or more men. No modesty here. At least the water is good and hot, soothing his tortured muscles. Bogs looms from the billowing steam, smiling, checking Andy up and down. Rooster and PETE appear from the sides. The Sisters. BOGS You're some sweet punk. You been broke in yet? Andy tries to step past them. He gets shoved around, nothing serious, just some slap and tickle. Jackals sizing up prey.
C: BOGS
D: Hard to get. I like that.
N: Andy breaks free, flushed and shaking. He hurries off, leaving the three Sisters laughing.
S: 35 INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1947) 35
N: Andy lies staring at the darkness, unable to sleep.
S: 36 EXT -- EXERCISE YARD -- DAY (1947) 36
N: Exercise period. Red plays catch with Heywood and Jigger, lazily tossing a baseball around. Red notices Andy off to the side. Nods hello. Andy takes this as a cue to amble over. Heywood and Jigger pause, watching.
C: ANDY
D: Hello. I'm Andy Dufresne.
E: offers his hand
N: Red glances at the hand, ignores it. The game continues.
C: RED
D: The wife-killin' banker.
C: ANDY
D: How do you know that?
C: RED
D: I keep my ear to the ground. Why'd you do it?
C: ANDY
D: I didn't, since you ask.
C: RED
D: Hell, you'll fit right in, then. Everyone's innocent in here, don't you know that? Heywood! What are you in for, boy?
E: off Andy's look
C: HEYWOOD
D: Didn't do it! Lawyer fucked me!
N: Red gives Andy a look. See?
C: ANDY
D: What else have you heard?
C: RED
D: People say you're a cold fish. They say you think your shit smells sweeter than ordinary. That true?
C: ANDY
D: What do you think?
C: RED
D: Ain't made up my mind yet.
N: Heywood nudges Jigger. Watch this. He winds up and throws the ball hard -- right at Andy's head. Andy sees it coming out of the corner of his eye, whirls and catches it. Beat. He sends the ball right back, zinging it into Heywood's hands. Heywood drops the ball and grimaces, wringing his stung hands.
C: ANDY
D: I understand you're a man who knows how to get things.
C: RED
D: I'm known to locate certain things from time to time. They seem to fall into my hands. Maybe it's 'cause I'm Irish.
C: ANDY
D: I wonder if you could get me a rock-hammer?
C: RED
D: What is it and why?
C: ANDY
D: You make your customers' motives a part of your business?
C: RED
D: If you wanted a toothbrush, I wouldn't ask questions. I'd just quote a price. A toothbrush, see, is a non-lethal sort of object.
C: ANDY
D: Fair enough. A rock-hammer is about eight or nine inches long. Looks like a miniature pickaxe, with a small sharp pick on one end, and a blunt hammerhead on the other. It's for rocks.
C: RED
D: Rocks.
N: Andy squats, motions Red to join him. Andy grabs a handful of dirt and sifts it through his hands. He finds a pebble and rubs it clean. It has a nice milky glow. He tosses it to Red.
C: RED
D: Quartz?
C: ANDY
D: Quartz, sure. And look. Mica. Shale. Silted granite. There's some graded limestone, from when they cut this place out of the hill.
C: RED
D: So?
C: ANDY
D: I'm a rockhound. At least I was, in my old life. I'd like to be again, on a limited scale.
C: RED
D: Yeah, that or maybe plant your toy in somebody's skull?
C: ANDY
D: I have no enemies here.
C: RED
D: No? Just wait.
N: Red flicks his gaze past Andy. Bogs is watching them.
C: RED
D: Word gets around. The Sisters have taken a real shine to you, yes they have. Especially Bogs.
C: ANDY
D: Tell me something. Would it help if I explained to them I'm not homosexual?
C: RED
D: Neither are they. You have to be human first. They don't qualify. Bull queers take by force, that's all they want or understand. I'd grow eyes in the back of my head if I were you.
E: off Andy's look
C: ANDY
D: Thanks for the advice.
C: RED
D: That comes free. But you understand my concern.
C: ANDY
D: If there's trouble, I doubt a rock- hammer will do me any good.
C: RED
D: Then I guess you wanna escape. Tunnel under the wall maybe? I miss the joke. What's so funny?
E: Andy laughs politely
N: ANDY You'll know when you see the rock- hammer.
C: RED
D: What's this item usually go for?
C: ANDY
D: Seven dollars in any rock and gem shop.
C: RED
D: My standard mark-up's twenty percent, but we're talkin' about a special object. Risk goes up, price goes up. Call it ten bucks even.
C: ANDY
D: Ten it is.
C: RED
D: I'll see what I can do. But it's a waste of money.
E: rises, slapping dust
C: ANDY
D: Oh?
C: RED
D: Folks who run this place love surprise inspections. They turn a blind eye to some things, but not a gadget like that. They'll find it, and you'll lose it. Mention my name, we'll never do business again. Not for a pair of shoelaces or a stick of gum.
C: ANDY
D: I understand. Thank you, Mr...?
C: RED
D: Red. The name's Red.
C: ANDY
D: Red. I'm Andy. Pleasure doing business with you.
N: They shake. Andy strolls off. Red watches him go.
C: RED
D: I could see why some of the boys took him for snobby. He had a quiet way about him, a walk and a talk that just wasn't normal around here. He strolled. like a man in a park without a care or worry. Like he had on an invisible coat that would shield him from this place. Yes, I think it would be fair to say I liked Andy from the start.
E: V.O. resumes playing catch
S: 37 INT -- MESS HALL -- DAY (1947) 37
N: Red gets his breakfast and heads for a table. Andy falls in step, slips him a tightly-folded square of paper.
S: 38 INT -- RED'S CELL -- NIGHT (1947) 38
N: Lying on his bunk, Red unfolds the square. A ten dollar bill.
C: RED
D: He was a man who adapted fast.
E: V.O.
S: 39 EXT -- LOADING DOCK -- DAY (1947) 39
N: Under watchful supervision, CONS are off-loading bags of dirty laundry from an "Eliot Nursing Home" truck.
C: RED
D: Years later, I found out he'd brought in quite a bit more than just ten dollars...
E: V.O.
N: A certain bag hits the ground. The TRUCK DRIVER shoots a look at a black con, LEONARD, then ambles over to a GUARD to shoot the shit. Leonard loads the bag onto a cart...
S: 40 INT -- PRISON LAUNDRY -- DAY (1947) 40
N: Bags are being unloaded. We find Leonard working the line.
C: RED
D: When they check you into this hotel, one of the bellhops bends you over and looks up your works, just to make sure you're not carrying anything. But a truly determined man can get an object quite a ways up there.
E: V.O.
N: Leonard slips a small paper-wrapped package out of the laundry bag, hides it under his apron, and keeps sorting... 4l INT -- PRISON LAUNDRY EXCHANGE -- DAY (1947) 41 Red deposits his dirty bundle and moves down the line to where the clean sheets are being handed out.
C: RED
D: That's how Andy joined our happy little Shawshank family with more than five hundred dollars on his person. Determination.
E: V.O.
N: Leonard catches Red's eye, turns and grabs a specific stack of clean sheets. He hands it across to Red -- TIGHT ANGLE -- and more than clean laundry changes hands. Two packs of cigarettes slide out of Red's hand into Leonard's.
S: 42 INT -- RED'S CELL -- DAY (1947) 42
N: Red slips the package out of his sheets, carefully checks to make sure nobody's coming, then rips it open. He pulls out the rock-hammer. It's just as Andy described. Red laughs softly.
C: RED
D: Andy was right. I finally got the joke. It would take a man about six hundred years to tunnel under the wall with one of these.
E: V.O.
S: 43 INT -- CELLBLOCK FIVE -- 2ND TIER -- NIGHT (1947) 43
N: Brooks Hatlen pushes a cart of books from cell to cell. The rolling library. He finds Red waiting for him. Red slips the rock-hammer, wrapped in a towel, through the bars and onto the cart. Next comes six cigarettes to pay for postage. RED Dufresne. Brooks nods, never missing a beat. He rolls his cart to Andy's cell, mutters through the bars:
C: BROOKS
D: Middle shelf, wrapped in a towel.
N: Andy's hand snakes through the bars and makes the object disappear. The hand comes back and deposits a small slip of folded paper along with more cigarettes. Brooks turns his cart around and goes back. He pauses, sorting his books long enough for Red to snag the slip of paper. Brooks continues on, scooping the cigarettes off the cart and into his pocket.
S: 44 INT -- RED'S CELL -- NIGHT (1947) 44
N: Red unfolds the slip of paper. Penciled neatly on it is a single word: "Thanks."
