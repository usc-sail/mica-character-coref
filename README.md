# Character Coreference Resolution in Movie Screenplays

This repository contains the source code and data for training a coreference resolution model for characters in movie
screenplays.

The work has been accepted to ACL Findings 2023.
You can read the paper 
[Character Coreference Resolution in Movie Screenplays](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-acl.654/)
to get more details. <br>
This builds upon our prior work in 
[Annotation and Evaluation of Coreference Resolution in Screenplays](https://aclanthology.org/2021.findings-acl.176/).

## Data

The __MovieCoref__ corpus is saved to the [data](data/) directory.

The __MovieCoref__ coreference annotations and screenplay documents can be found in the [data/labels](data/labels/) 
and [data/screenplay](data/screenplay/) directories, respectively.
[data/movies.txt](data/movies.txt) contains the name of the movies and their raters.
[data/parse.csv](data/parse.csv) contains the line-level structural tags of the screenplays, obtained after 
screenplay parsing.

The [data/addsays](data/addsays/), [data/nocharacters](data/nocharacters/), and [data/regular](data/regular/) 
are JSON-preprocessed versions of the __MovieCoref__ corpus, which are more convenient for programmatic usage.

- The _addsays_ version adds the word "says" between speakers and their utterance.
- The _nocharacters_ version omits the speakers entirely from the screenplay.
- The _regular_ version does not make any changes.

We recommend using the _regular_ version.

## Training

### Set up

Create a python 3 conda environment from the `env.yml` file.

```
conda env create --file env.yml
```

### Inter-rater Agreement

Find the interrater agreement of the annotators that labeled the __MovieCoref__ corpus.
The annotations on the validation set used to calculate the interrater agreement scores can be found in the 
[data/validation](data/validation/) directory.

```
python rater.py
```

### Training

Preprocess the screenplay documents and the annotation labels.
This creates preprocessed JSON files.

```
python preprocess.py --gold
bash train.sh
```

## Prediction

Given a movie script for which you want to find the character coreference clusters, you need to first parse it to
get the line-level tags.
You can use the [Movie Screenplay Parser](https://github.com/usc-sail/mica-screenplay-parser) to do this task.
Refer to its repository regarding how to use it.

```python
from movie_coref import preprocess
from movie_coref.movie_coref import MovieCoreference

# SCRIPT_FILE and PARSE_FILE are the filepaths to the script and parse file
# you can preprocess more than one movie by providing multiple script and parse files
# movie_data will be a list of processed movie scripts
movie_data = preprocess([SCRIPT_FILE], [PARSE_FILE])

# Instantiate the coreference model and pass the preprocessed data
movie_coref = MovieCoreference(
        preprocessed_data=movie_data,
        weights_file=WEIGHTS_FILE,
        hierarchical=HIERARCHICAL,
        document_len=SUBDOC_LEN,
        overlap_len=OVERLAP_LEN,
        n_representative_mentions=REPK,
        )

# Perform the inference
# movie_data will contain the predicted clusters
movie_data = movie_coref.predict()
```

Set WEIGHTS_FILE to `data/Mar09_01:31:43PM_24839/movie_coref.pt`. <br>
Set HIERARCHICAL to `True` if you wish to use the hierarchical mode, otherwise the fusion-based mode will be used
(refer to the paper).

SUBDOC_LEN is the length of the subdocuments into which the movie script is split. <br>
OVERLAP_LEN is the overlap length between the subdocuments for the fusion mode. <br>
REPK is the number of representatives per cluster for the hierarchical mode.
All details of these hyperparameters can be found in the paper.

Default values of SUBDOC_LEN, OVERLAP_LEN, and REPK are 5120, 2048, and 3.
