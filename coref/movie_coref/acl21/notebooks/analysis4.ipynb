STIGLITZ Wonderful name , Sgt. SGT . POLA NEGRI Thank you , Lieutenant . When he \\'s old enough to ride a bicycle , I will buy him a blue one . And I will paint on the side \" The Blue Max \" . He thrusts out his beer stein , for the officers to cheers . They do . Bridget finishes signing her autograph , with a big flourish . BRIDGET There you go . But wait , I \\'m not finished yet . She reaches into her clutch , and pulls out some lipstick . Applies some ruby red color to her lips , and then kisses the napkin , leaving a big red lip print . Then hands the treasured item to the young father . BRIDGET Nothing but the best for little Maximilian . SGT . POLA NEGRI Thank you fraulein , thank you . Max may not know who you are now . But he will . I will show him all of your movies . He will grow up with your films , and this napkin on his wall . Then , to the whole tavern ... SGT . POLA NEGRI I purpose a toast to the greatest actress in Germany ! There is no Dietrich , there is no Riefenstahl , only Von Hammersmark ! The whole room toasts . This would be a good time for the German Sgt to go back to his table , and his men . And he almost does .... but ... since he is drunk , and star struck , he out wears his welcome . SGT . POLA NEGRI So , Frau Von Hammersmark , what brings you to France ? 97 . Feeling any good Nazi officer \\'s patience would of been exhausted long ago , Lt. Hicox butts in . LT.
