      "EXT - LA LOUISIANE (TAVERN) - NIGHTWe see a small basement tavern, with a old rustic sign out front that reads, \"La Louisiane\".A SUBTITLE APPEARS:\"The Village ofNADINE, FRANCE\"TWO SHOT LT.HICOX and LT.ALDO RAINE Aldo is dressed like a French civilian. Hicox is dressed in a German grey S.S. Cap't uniform. They look out of a window, in a apartment, in the village of Nadine, overlooking the tavern.LT.ALDOYou didn't say the goddamn rendez-vous was in a fuckin basement.LT.HICOXI didn't know.LT.ALDOYou said it was in a tavern?LT.HICOXit is a tavern.LT.ALDOYeah, in a basement. You know, fightin in a basement offers a lot of difficulties, number one being, your fighting in a basement. Wilhelm Wicki, joins the SHOT, dressed in a German S.S. Lieutenant uniform.WICKIWhat if we go in there, and she's not even there?LT.HICOXWe wait. Don't worry, she's a British spy, she'll make the rendez-vous. WE SEE the other Basterds, dressed in French civilian clothes, are in the room as well, they are, Donowitz, Hirschberg, and Utivich. And in the back of the room, dressed in the grey uniform of a S.S. Lieutenant, Hugo Stiglitz sits off by himself, sharpening his S.S. DAGGER on his leather belt looped around his boot. Anybody not in the scene from the Basterds opening chapter, is dead. Lt.Hicox watches Stiglitz off by himself on the other side of the room, SHARPENS his dagger menacingly. .Stiglitz is fucking werid... Lt.Hicox approaches Stiglitz...LT.NICOXStiglitz, right?STIGLITZThat's right, sir. He continues bringing the blades edge, up, then, down on the leather strap.LT.HICOXI hear your pretty good with that? Meaning the blade. Stiglitz doesn't answer.LT.HICOXYou know, we're not looking for trouble, right now. We're simply making contact with our agent. Should be uneventful. However, on the off chance I'm wrong, and things prove eventful. I need to know, we can all remain calm.The renegade Gerry Sergeant, stops his blades progress, and looks up at the limy Lieutenant.STIGLITZI don't look calm to you?LT.HICOXWell, now you put it like that,I guess you do.He turns his attention back to his blade. Hicox moves over to Aldo, and asks him privately;LT. HI COXThis Gerry of yours, Stiglitz? Not exactly the loquacious type, is he? Aldo just looks at him.LT.ALDOIs that the kinds man you need, the loquacious type?LT.HICOXFair point, Lieutenant.LT.ALDOSo y'all git in trouble in there, what are we suppose to do? Make bets on how it all comes out?LT.HICOXIf we get into trouble, we can handle it. But if trouble does happen, we need you to make damn sure no Germans, or French, for matter, escape from that basement. If Frau Von Hammersmark's cover is compromised, the mission is kaput.SGT.DONOWITZSpeaking of Frau Von Hammersmark, who's idea was it for the death trap redez-vous?LT.HICOXShe chose the spot.SGT.DONOWITZWell isn't that just dandy?LT.HICOXLook, she's not a military strategist. She's just a actress.LT.ALDOYa don't got to be Stonewall Jackson to know you don't want to fight in a basement.LT.HICOXShe wasn't picking a place to fight. She was picking a place, isolated, and without germans.PFC.HIRSCHBERGLieutenant, I hate to be contrary, but I got me a Nazi pissin on Louisianna two-o'clock. They move to the window, and sure enough, ONE LONE NAZI PRIVATE, relieves himself against the side wall. Lt.Bicox, this was definitely, not the plan.LT.HICOXShit. Sgt.Donowitz chides him;SGT.DONOWITZSo what do you think your fraulein Von Hammer -LT.HICOX- Obviously, I don't know,Sgt. The British officer watches the German soldier, who's not suppose to be there. When Hugo Stiglitz joins him at the window. Stiglitz looks down at the urinating Nazi, S.S. dagger in hand.STIGLITZIf we're going, let's go. He sheaths the dagger.EXT - LA LOUISIANE (BASEMENT TAVERN) - NIGHTThe GERMAN PISSING PRIVATE, sloppily finishes his task. Craming his noodle back in his pants, he descends the stairs that lead him back into the basement tavern. We Follow him...INT - LA LOUISIANE (BASEMENT TAVERN)- NIGHT.Inside the basement tavern, La Louisiane. it has a very low hanging basement ceiling. A old looking wood bar off to the right. And the only other space in the little tavern, is taken up by two large(at least in here) tables, which take up both half's of the room. And despite rumors to the contrary, one of the two tables, is completely filled with drunken celebrating Nazi enlisted men, of which our urinating friend is one of five.FIVE NAZI'SONE GERMAN MASTER SGT, ONE FEMALE GERMAN SGT , and THREE MALE GERMAN PRIVATES. The Five Nazi's are sitting around the table, drinking, and playing a very fun game with none other then the fraulein of the hour, UFA diva, BRIDGET VON HAMMERSMARK. Dressed to the nines in a chic Forties style women's suit, complete with fedora. The game their playing consists of each player having a card with the name of a famous person, real or imaginary, stuck to their forehead. The player doesn't know what name is on their forehead. So they ask the others questions to figure out who they are. The Five Germans, five cards read; MASTER SGT #1POLA NEGRIFEMALE SGT #2(BEETHOVEN), GERMAN PRIVATE #3(MATA HARI), GERMAN PRIVATE #4 (EDGAR WALLACE), GERMAN PRIVATE #5 (WINNETOU). And Bridget Von Hammersmark, who wears her card in the brim of her fedora, has GENGHIS KHAN. It's German#5 (WINNETOU) turn to ask questions. The DIALOGUE will be in GERMAN, and SUBTITLED into ENGLISH. Also, while some dialogue will be written for the German Soldiers, it will be mostly made up from the exuberance of their game playing, and celebrating.WINNETOU.okay, I'm not German. Am I American? The whole table bursts out laughing.FEMALE SGT/BEETHOVENYes you arelEDGAR WALLACEWell, not really.SGT.POLA NEGRIWhat do you mean, not really? Of course he is.EDGAR WALLACEWell if he's so American, how come he's never been translated into English? He's not American. He's suppose to be American, but he's not a American creation. In fact, he's something very different.WINNETOUOkay, I'm a fictional, literary character, from the past, I'm American, and that's controversial.BRIDGET/GENGUSNo it's not controversial. The nationally of the author, has nothing to do with the nationally of the character. The Character is the character. Hamlet's not British, he's Danish. So yes, this character was born in America.WINNETOUWell I'm glad that's settled. If I had a wife, would she be called a squaw? He's got it. The table Laughs. The TABLEYES!WINNETOUIs my bloodbrother, Old Shatterhand?The TABLEYes!WINNETOUDid Karl May write me?The TABLEYes! In the BACKGROUND, WE SEE, our three counterfeit German Officers, Hicox, Wicki, and Stiglitz, enter the basement tavern. They obviously. see the five German soldiers, but their too far away for us to read their face. No doubt their less then happy. Fraulein Von Hammersmark see's them as well. Without getting up, she waves to them. QZBRIDGETHello, my lovelies, I will join you in moments. I'm finishing up a game with my five new friends here.LT.HICOXNo hurry, Frau Von Hammersmark. Take your time, enjoy yourself.BRIDGETSo who are you? WINNETOUI am WINNETOU, CHIEF of the APACHES! The table CHEERS, and APPLAUD the Apache Chief, as he takes the card off his forehead. The other Four German Soldiers drink down there beer . Bridget Von Hammersmark knock backs her champagne.   MATA HARIFrau Von Hammersmark, when your friends came in, did you realize you did a double take, like in the movies?BRIDGETReally? No, I wasn't aware of that at all.MATA HARIThey must be second nature to you now? Did they teach you how to do a double take in the movies?BRIDGETWell, yes they did, but it's not really that difficult.SGT.POLA NEGRIDo one for us. The Tableheartily agrees. Bridget looks directly at the Master Sgt, and does a perfect, and perfectly funny, Double Take. The Table loves it.q3.MATA HARIMy turn, I want to try. Mata Hari, looks directly at Beethoven, and does a Double Take.EDGER WALLACE I want to try.He does. Soon the whole Table is doing dueling Double Takes.HICOX - WICKI - STIGLITZ watch the table do dueling Double Takes. Obviously, they don't understand.THEN....Bridget Von Hammersmark rises, and excuses herself from the Table. She removes the card stuck in her fedora, looking at the name Gengus Khaun for the first time.BRIDGETGengus Khaun! I would never of gotten that. She walks over, and joins the masquerading Germans table, the Gentlemen rise. She greets each warmly with a french cheek kiss, as if she knows them well. They all take a seat. The two Basterds, and one Brit, drink Whiskey. The taverns PROPRIETOR, a older, big bellyed Frenchman named EARL, comes over to the table, and pours more champagne into Bridget's Champagne glass. He leaves, returning back behind the bar, with the YOUNG FRENCH BARMAID, the only other person in the establishment. Obviously, they speak GERMAN, SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;LT.HICOXI thought this place was suppose to have more French then Germans?BRIDGETNormally that's true. The Sgt over there's wife, just had a baby. His commanding officer gave him, and his mates the night off to celebrate.WICXIWe should leave.BRIDGETF No, we should stay. For one drink at least. I've been waiting for you in a bar, it would look strange if we left before we had a drink.LT.HICOXShe's right, just be calm, and enjoy your booze.BACK TO THE GERMAN TABLE The French Barmaid, has taken Bridget's place in the rousing, rowdy game. She tells them, her person must be French, or she won't know them. Winnetou thinks for a moment, then writes a name on a card. The Barmaid puts it on her forehead, It says;NAPOLEON.The Germans all laugh.BACK TO THE BASTERDS TABLEBRIDGETThere's been some new developments. The cinema venue has changed.LT.HICOXWhy?BRIDGETNo one knows. But that in itself shouldn't be a problem. The cinema it's been changed to is considerably smaller then The Ritz. So whatever materials you brought for The Ritz, should be doubly effective here. Now this next piece of information is colossal, try not to over react. The Fubrer, will be attending tomorrow. Hugo Stiglitz does a SPIT TAKE. Bridget's eyes bore holes in him.BACK TO THE REAL GERMANS They see Hugo do the spit take, and burst out laughing. Keeping it up, they begin to do dueling spit takes, like they did dueling double takes earlier. Needless to say, they all get wet. BACK TO BASTERDSBRIDGETYou'll be going as Ernst Schuller. You'll say your a associate producer on Riefenstahl's \"Tiefland\". It's the one German production not under Goebbels control, and Leni wouldn't be caught dead at a Goebbels film affair. BACK TO REAL GERMAN TABLE Master Sgt.Pola Negri, drinks his beer, as he looks over, dreamily, at Bridget Von Hammersmark at the other table.BACK TO BASTERDSWe See in Bridget continues to brief Hicox on his identity. the B.G., the German Master Sgt stand up from his table, and head toward Fraulein Von Bammersmark.BRIDGET.the films gone through many delays, and Leni's heath is deteriorating, so if you have to speak... Hicox, seeing the German Master Sgt approach, signals for her to cool it.SGT.POLA NEGRIFrau Von Hammersmark, I was just thinking, could you sign a autograph to my son on his birthday?BRIDGETI'd love to Wilhelm. This handsome happy Sgt, just became a father today. The Pretend Officers offer congratulations to the Sgt. The German Master Sgt, CLICKS his heels, and bows before his superior officers.  SGT.POLA NEGRIThank you, heil Hitler. He raises his hand .... as do the seated phony officers; \"Heil Hitler\". As she takes a rather fancy fountain pen from her clutch..BRIDGETSo Wilhelm, do you know the name of this progeny yet?SGT.POLA NEGRII most certainly do, fraulein. His name is Maximilian. Even the slightly psychotic Stiglitz, likes this German Sgt.STIGLITZWonderful name, Sgt.SGT.POLA NEGRIThank you, Lieutenant. When he's old enough to ride a bicycle, I will buy him a blue one. And I will paint on the side \"The Blue Max\". He thrusts out his beer stein, for the officers to cheers. They do. Bridget finishes signing her autograph, with a big flourish.BRIDGETThere you go. But wait, I'm not finished yet. She reaches into her clutch, and pulls out some lipstick. Applies some ruby red color to her lips, and then kisses the napkin, leaving a big red lip print. Then hands the treasured item to the young father.BRIDGETNothing but the best for little Maximilian.SGT.POLA NEGRIThank you fraulein, thank you. Max may not know who you are now. But he will. I will show him all of your movies. He will grow up with your films, and this napkin on his wall. Then, to the whole tavern...SGT.POLA NEGRII purpose a toast to the greatest actress in Germany! There is no Dietrich, there is no Riefenstahl, only Von Hammersmark! The whole room toasts. This would be a good time for the German Sgt to go back to his table, and his men. And he almost does.... but... since he is drunk, and star struck, he out wears his welcome.SGT.POLA NEGRISo, Frau Von Hammersmark, what brings you to France?97 . Feeling any good Nazi officer's patience would of been exhausted long ago, Lt.Hicox butts in.LT.HICOXNone of your business,Sgt. You might not have worn out your welcome with the fraulein, with your drunken boorish behavior, but you have wore out your welcome with me. The Table of game playing Soldiers, hear this, and get quiet.LT.HICOXMight I remind you Sgt.,your a enlisted man. This is a officers table. I suggest you stop pestering the fraulein, and rejoin your table. The German Master Sgt., looks quizzically at the officer.SGT.POLA NEGRIExcuse me Cap't, but your accent is is very unusual. The whole room pauses-for different reasons...SGT.POLA NEGRIWhere are you from? A silent moment passes between the two tables, then the two German born impostors spring into action.WICKISgt.! You must be ether drunk or mad, to speak to a superior officer with such impertinentness! Stiglitz, STANDS and YELLS to the other table;STIGLITZ I'm making YOU,...(Pointing atWINNETOU) .and YOU,...responsible, for him. I suggest you take hold of your friend, or he'll spend Max's first birthday in jail for public drunkenness!      The Germans SPRING UP, and take hold of Sgt.Pola... 1WWHEN...A GERMAN VOICE rings out;GERMAN VOICE Then might I inquire?The Five known Germans move aside, reveling the unknown German in the room, unseen till now, our old friend from before MAJOR DEITER HELLSTROM of the GESTAPO. The Major stands from the little table he was sitting at.MAJOR HELLSTROMLike the young newly christened father, I too have a acute ear for accents. And like him, I too find yours odd. From where do you hail, Cap't? Wicki jumps in;WICKIMajor, this is highly inappr -MAJOR HELLSTROMT wasn't speaking to you Lt.Saltzberg, (Turning toSTIGLITZ)or you ether, Lt.Berlin. (Looking atHICOX)I was speaking to Cap't I--don't-know-what. The Gestapo Major is now standing beside Sgt.Pola, before the impostors table. Lt.Hicox, calmly explains his origin.LT.HICOXI was born in the village that rests in the shadow of Piz Palu.MAJOR HELLSTROMThe mountain?LT.HICOXYes. In that village we all speak like this. Have you seen the Riefenstahl film?MAJOR HELLSTROMYes.f q sLT. HICOXThen you saw me. You remember the skiing torch scene?MAJOR HELLSTROMYes I do.LT.HICOXIn that scene was myself, my father, my sister, and my two brothers. My brother is so handsome, the director Pabst, gave him a Close Up. As Bridget Von Hammersmark places a cigarette in a ivory cigarette holder, which Hicox, as if on cue, lights for her, she says;BRIDGETMajor, if my word means anything, I can vouch for everything the Young Cap't has just said. He does hail from the bottom of Piz Palu, he was in the film, and his brother is far more handsome then he. The impostors laugh. Then....so does the Gestapo Major. He turns to the Sgt.MAJOR HELLSTROMYou should rejoin your friends. Which the young Sgt is more then happy to do. That table begins playing there game again. Major Hellstrom, the highest ranking officer in the room, bows graciously to the female German celebrity.MAJOR HELLSTROMMay I join you?BRIDGETBy all means, Major. The Gestapo Major sits at the table, opposite Lt.Hicox, and Wicki. The French Barmaid brings over the Majors beer stein.MAJOR HELLSTROMSo that's the source of your bazaar accent? Extraordinary. So what are you doing here Cap't?LT.HICOXAside from having a drink with the lovely fraulein?,00 .MAJOR HELLSTROMWell that pleasure requires no explanation. Chuckle...ChuckleMAJOR HELLSTROMI mean in country. Your obviously not stationed in France, or I'd know who you are.LT I'! I COXYou know every German in France?MAJOR BELLSTROMWorth knowing.LT.HICOXWell, there in lies the problem. We never claimed to be worth knowing. Chuckle... Chuckle.MAJOR HELLSTROMAll levity aside, what are you doing in France?   LT.HICOXAttending Goebbels film premiere as the frauleins escort.MAJOR HELLSTROMYour the frauleins escort?LT.HICOXSomebody has to carry the lighter. Chuckle chuckle.BRIDGETThe Captain is my date, but all three are my guests. We're old friends Major, who go back along time. Longer then a actress would care to admit. Chuckle chuckle.MAJOR HELLSTROMWell, in that case, let me raise a glass to the three luckiest men in the room.BRIDGETI'll drink to that.They cheers. BACK TO THE REAL GERMAN TABLE They continue to have alot of fun playing their game. BACK TO OFFICERS TABLEMAJOR HELLSTROMI must say, that game their playing looks like a good bit of fun. I didn't join them, because your quite right Cap't, officers and enlisted men shouldn't fraternize. But seeing as we're all officers here, (Bowing toBRIDGET).and sophisticated lady friends of officers. What say we play the game? Lt.Hicox begins to refuse, when Bridget feeling she knows betterBRIDGETokay, one game.MAJOR HELLSTROMWUNDERBARThe Major borrows five cards from the other table, and lays them out in front of Bridget and the officers.MAJOR HELLSTROMSo the object of the game, is to write the name of a famous person on your card. Real or fictitious, doesn't matter. For instance, you could write Confucius or Fu Manchu. (He SNAPS hisFINGERS)Eric' More pens. And they must be famous. No Aunt Inga's. When you finish writing, put the card face down on the table, and move it to the person to your left. The person to your right, will move their card in front of you. You pick up the card without looking at it, lick the back, and stick it on your forehead like so. He demonstrates.  )oz. MAJOR HELLSTROM (CON'T) And in ten yes or no questions, you must guess who you are... As Major Hellstrom finishes explaining the finer points of the game, The CAMERA PANS OFF HIM, and BEGINS SLOWLY ZOOMING INTO STIGLITZ. The Majors dialogue begins to FADE AWAY. Untill we're in a SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK. Which is RED FILTERED FOOTAGE of Hugo being savagely WHIPPED by somebody wearing a GESTAPO UNIFORM, SUPERIMPOSED over his CLOSE UP. The Flashback disappears. It's driving Stiglitz crazy, being this close to a Gestapo uniform, and not plunging a knife into it. The Majors Voice comes back on the soundtrack.MAJOR HELLSTROM.So let's give it a try, shall we? Everybody write your names. The Five players write their names... Then move their cards to the right... Everybody sticks their cards on their forehead...MAJORBRIDGETWILHELMARCHIEHUGOHELLSTROMVON HAMMERSMARKWICKIHICOXSTIGLITZis is is is isKING MARCOBULLDOGBRIGITTEG.W. KONG POLO DRUMMOND HELM PABSTMAJ.KING KONGI'll start, give you the idea.Am I German?They laugh.BRIDGETNo.MAJ.KING KONG Am I a American?They laugh - but then Wicki says;WICKIWait a minute, he goes to!03 .BRIDGETDon't be ridiculous, obviously he wasn't born in America.MAJ.KING KONGSo... . I visited America, aye? The Table says; \"Yes\".MAJ.KING KONGWas this vist...fortuitous?WICKINot for you.MAJ.KING KONG.Bummm. My native land, is it what one would call, exotic? The Table confers, and decides, yes it is exotic.MAJ.KING KONGHummmm. That could be ether a reference to the jungle, or the Orient. I'm going to let my first instinct take over, and ask, am I from the jungle? The Tablesays; \"Yes you are\".MAJ.KING KONGNow gentlemen, around this time you could ask, weather your real or fictitious. I however, think that's too easy, so I won't ask that, yet. Okay, my native land is the jungle? I visited America, but my visit was not fortuitous to me, but the implication is that it was to somebody else. When I went from the jungle to America,... .Did I go by boat? \"Yes\".MAJ.KING KONGDid I go against my will? \"Yes\".MAJ.KING KONGOn this boat ride, ... . Was I in chains?\"YESISMAJ.KING KONGWhen I arrived in America,...Was I displayed in chains? \"Yes\".MAJ.KING KONGAm I the story of the Negro in America? The Table says, \"No\".MAJ.KING KONGWell then I must be King Kong. Be throws the card on the table. They applaud him.MAJOR HELLSTROMNov since I answered correctly, you all need to finnish your drinks. The three counterfeit Nazi's knock back their whiskey.MAJOR HELLSTROMNow, who's next?LT.HICOXMajor, I don't mean to be rude. But the four of us are very good friends. And the four of us haven't seen each other in quite a while. So... Major, I'm afraid, you are intruding.MAJOR HELLSTROMI beg to differ Cap't. It's only if the fraulein considers my presence a intrusion, that I become a intruder. How about it fraulein? Am I intruding?BRIDGETOf course not, Major.MAJOR HELLSTROMI didn't think so. It's simply the young Cap't is immune to my charms. The Table's not sure what to do, is this a confrontation? Then, the Major laughs.MAJOR HELLSTROMI'm just joking, of course I'm intruding.MAJOR HELLSTROMAllow me to refill your glasses gentlemen, and I will bid you and the fraulein adieu. Eric has a bottle of thirty-three year old single malt scotch whisky from the Scottish highlands. What do you say gentlemen? LT.HICOXYour most gracious, sir.MAJOR HELLSTROMEric, the thirty-three, and new glasses! You don't want to contaminate the thirty- three with the swill you were drinking.ERICHow many glasses?LT.HICOXFive glasses.MAJOR HELLSTROMNot me. I like scotch, scotch doesn't like me.BRIDGETNor I. I'll stay with bubbly. Lt.Bicox, hold up three fingers , to Eric the owner.  LT.HICOXThree glasses. Eric brings the three glasses, and the old bottle, pouring for the three soldiers. Major Helistrom lifts up his beer stein, and toasts;MAJOR HELLSTROMTo a thousand year Reich! They all mutter, \"a thousand year reich\", and toast glasses. The Gestapo Major puts down his beer stein, and then WE HEAR a CLICK, under the table.MAJOR HELLSTROMDid you hear that? That's the sound of my Luger pointed right at your testicles.!Q(LT.HICOXWhy do you have a Luger pointed at my testicles?MAJOR HELLSTROMBecause you've just given yourself away, Cap't. Your no more German then that scotch.LT.HICOXWell, -Major -BRIDGET- Major -MAJOR HELLSTROM- Shut up slut. You were saying? LT.HICOXI was saying that makes two of us. I've had a gun pointed at your balls since you sat down.SGT.STIGLITZThat makes three of us.UNDERTABLEWe See all three guns pointed at appropriate crotches. As well as Bridget's legs, right besides the Nazi Major's. Her pretty gams are sure to be chewed up in the possible crossfire.SGT.STIGLITZAnd at this range, I'm a real Fredrick Zoller. Hugo alsobrings out his dagger, and sitcks it in the table top.MAJOR HELLSTROMHummmmm ... Looks like we have a bit of a sticky situation here.LT. H ICOXWhat's going to happen, Major, is your going to stand up, and walk out that door with us.MAJOR HELLSTROMNo no no no no no, I don't think so. I'm afraid you and I both know, no matter what happens to anybody else in this room, the two of us aren't going anywhere.\"7 .MAJOR HELLSTROMToo bad about them though. They seem like a likeable You two will have to shoot them.          BRIDGETThen Major, i implore you. For the sake of those German troops, will you please leave with us?MAJOR HELLSTROMOh Bridget, your concern for German troops, gets me .right here. You mean for the sake your whore legs, don't you? You can't afford to get any bullet holes in them, your not finished spreading them for all the Hollywood Jews. Lt.Hicox picks up his thirty-three year old single malt scotch, and says;   LT.HICOX (ENGLISH) 'Well, if this is it old boy, I hope you dont mind if I go out speaking the kings? MAJOR HELLSTROM (ENGLISH) By all means, Cap't. The English film critic, commando, picks up the thirty-three the Nazi Major bought him, and says;LT.HICOXThere's a special rung in hell reserved for people who waste good scotch. And seeing as I might be rapping on the door momentarily... He downs the stuff.LT.HICOX(To the NaziMAJOR)I must say, damn good stuff, sir.He puts the glass down.LT.HICOXNow about this, \"Pickle\", we find ourself's in. It would appear, there's only thing left for you to do.MAJOR HELLSTROM (ENGLISH) And what would that be?LT.HICOXStiglitz.STIGLITZSay, auf wiedersehen to your balls!STIGLITZ FIRES into HELLSTROM'S BALLS...As does HICOX, HITTING not only Hellstrom, but BRIDGET as well.HELLSTROMFIRES into HICOX'S BALLS and KNEE CAPS.STIGLITZthen JUMPS over the table, and begins STABBING HELLSTROM with theDAGGER.HICOX FALLS to the floor....DEAD.
